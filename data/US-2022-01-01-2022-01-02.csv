"Even as many stay open, small businesses are feeling omicron's impact","Small businesses around the country are feeling the impact of the surge in new COVID-19 cases, primarily driven by the omicron variant. The spread of the virus is causing staffing issues, higher costs and fewer customers, they say.

Some businesses said they have been forced to temporarily shut down because they do not have enough staff to stay open, while others are over-scheduling staff for shifts, just in case anyone gets sick and can't come in.

The Roguelike Tavern, a bar in Burbank, California, announced it will remain closed after its Christmas break, at least until next Monday, but will only be offering takeout and delivery.

The risk of exposure for the bar's staff became apparent when they kept hearing people they were in contact with test positive for COVID, according to John McCormick, the owner of The Roguelike Tavern.

""We had a couple of near-misses at the bar,"" McCormick told ABC News. ""Folks that were in one night were posting on their social media the next [day] about testing positive. Even with [Burbank's] high vaccination rate, it was just everywhere,"" McCormick said.

At least 75% of residents in Los Angeles have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to LA County.

The decision to close meant the bar canceled all its events scheduled for this week, including karaoke, trivia and a New Year's Eve party.

""We're a small bar, no windows, very little ventilation; to have a bunch of people singing at the top of their lungs, that just wasn't gonna fly,"" McCormick said.

McCormick will be scaling back his staffing while only serving takeout and delivery. This means his hourly-paid staff will be earning less money.

""I'm going to be setting up a Venmo for them to hopefully get some regulars to help support them in case we have to be closed for an extended period of time.""

While kitchen workers are paid above minimum wage, McCormick is worried about his bartenders, who are paid the minimum wage, which he said is barely a livable wage in Los Angeles.

""My bartenders are looking at pretty paltry tips for at least the next couple of weeks,"" McCormick said.

McCormick hopes his business, which he opened this year, is in a good position to make it through the next few weeks of closure now that he has a regular customer base looking to support it. If the number of cases decreases, he plans to reopen fully on Jan. 19.

The Roguelike Tavern is far from the only small business that had to close its doors. Franklin Barbecue, a restaurant in Austin, Texas, closed its dining room last week after multiple staff members tested positive for COVID-19, according to its Facebook page.

""Due to the absence of these team members, we don’t have enough staff to operate. It takes a village to run this restaurant and we hope to have enough healthy folks in time to reopen next Tuesday,"" the restaurant said in the post.

Kome, a sushi restaurant in Austin, Texas, also closed to conduct a health and safety check for staff due to a COVID-19 exposure, according to its social media page.

Kome then had to extend its closure period because it was ""having trouble getting staff tested quickly and getting results quickly,"" its Instagram page said.

After two employees tested positive for the virus, the restaurant shut down on Dec. 18 and staff was told to get tested. Testing appointments were not readily available considering it was a week before Christmas, Kome's director of operations Elizabeth Hyman told ABC News.

While most staff members were able to get tested by Dec. 20, some couldn't get appointments until Dec. 21. When the decision was made to reopen, not all the staffs' test results had come back.

""I was staying in contact with the management team throughout the entire process, checking in with everyone on results and made the call late Tuesday night to reopen for dinner service Wednesday at 4. If we didn't get the remaining test results in time, we would just have run with a skeleton crew and made due,"" Hyman said.

The remaining test results came back negative.

Hyman said she is frustrated with how difficult it was to find testing sites that take walk-ins or have available appointments in addition to how expensive PCR tests have become.

Testing sites with immediate availability were charging more than $160. One of the places she found was charging $280.

""I was very disappointed that, after nearly two years of dealing with this virus, we still don't have the necessary resources available to everyone, regardless of income level, to be able to get tested and help fight the spread of this deadly virus,"" Hyman said.

Kome has only been open for curbside pickup since March 2020. The restaurant was closed for a total of four days, and even that short period took a toll on the business.

""Having to close the week of Christmas, when everyone has family in town, and kids are out of school, was a huge financial hit to us, not to mention the products we had to throw away. We get fresh produce deliveries daily, fresh chicken, fresh fish, prepped food, all of it had to be discarded,"" Hyman said.

Kome's staff was not the only one unable to get their test results quickly. An employee at The Brattle Bookshop, a used bookstore in Boston, was out of work for five days while waiting for a COVID test result, its owner told ABC News. The test eventually came back negative.

Because he had symptoms, the employee was a little more restricted about where he could get a COVID test, an added hurdle on top of labs already overwhelmed with tests, Ken Gloss, the owner and proprietor of The Brattle Bookshop, told ABC News.

This is a problem Tarik Fallous, the owner of Au Za'atar, a Lebanese restaurant with two locations in New York City, has also had. As a result, some employees have had to stay home for five or six days to get their test results. Others, however, have only needed to stay home for two days.

Some of Gloss' staff have been missing work in the last few weeks because those supposed to take care of their children were testing positive for COVID.

""It happens. In the best of times, childcare can be an issue. And this time, it's happened much more than we would want it to be. But we've managed,"" Gloss said to ABC News.

Fallous said being safe and telling the staff to stay home if they are not feeling well has had a significant economic impact on his small business.

""We always have to schedule additional staff in case one or two staff members don't come to work or are not feeling well … which can be costly for a small restaurant,"" Fallous said.

By not scheduling additional staff, Fallous would be risking losing customers.

""The other option would be not to add additional staff, but take a chance, and then possibly sacrifice quality or service. And on the long run wouldn't be a good thing for restaurants,"" he said.

Fallous said business has been very ""inconsistent"" in the last few weeks. On days where the number of cases are high, the restaurant sees a lot of cancelations. When the case numbers are not as high, he said Au Za'atar gets a lot of reservations.

""They're not behaving as they were maybe like a month ago,"" Fallous said. ""I see a lot of people who are requesting to sit in the outdoor area where it's not covered.""

Fallous has also seen more customers putting in takeout or delivery orders.

""I see the increase in the business' takeout and delivery, much more now than earlier the pandemic,"" Fallous said.

Fallous said the price of shifting away from in-person dining could be costing the business up to 30% or 40%, depending on the size of the order.

""All the fees associated with deliveries can become costly. So financially, it is not a great benefit, but the benefit is being able to reach our customers and deliver it to them,"" he said.

Gloss was surprised by how well his bookstore did during the holiday season, even compared to before the pandemic. But, he has noticed business slowing down in the last few days. Gloss said the omicron variant came on so fast that people have only just started reacting to the rise in cases.

Gloss said the surge has caused a slowdown of businesses from some groups more than others.

""Very, very noticeably, the average age of the people coming in is 20, 30 or 40 years younger than normal. A lot of our old customers, the regulars and the elderly, we're not seeing them at all,"" Gloss said. ""I think they are much more worried.""

Fallous, whose business relies on many goods imported from Lebanon, said costs that have risen during the pandemic have been going up even more in just the last few weeks due to omicron.

It is becoming more difficult for the business to get supplies it uses and often suppliers are putting limits on the number of products Au Za'atar can buy, he said.

""They don't have enough and they want to supply everyone and on top of this, the price has tremendously increased,"" he said.",None

US companies are thriving despite the pandemic—or because of it,"Nearly two years after the coronavirus pandemic brought much of the U.S. economy to a halt, public companies are recording some of their best ever financial results.

Profit growth is strong. Most companies’ sales are higher than where they were before Covid-19—often well above. The liquidity crunch many feared in 2020 never materialized, leaving companies with sizable cash cushions. The stock market ended 2021 near record highs and far fewer public companies filed for bankruptcy in 2021 than in the years before the pandemic.

""At the start of the pandemic, if you asked us to look forward, I don’t think we would have expected this outcome,"" said Brian Kloss, a portfolio manager for Brandywine Global, a unit of Franklin Resources Inc. that manages about $67 billion in assets. ""This has been very different than any other cycle we’ve seen.""

Government programs provided funding for businesses, helping them keep workers, while enhanced unemployment benefits and direct aid to consumers also kept income up, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.

""The support to households was greater than in the past, so that really helped fuel consumer spending,"" she said. ""That’s what fueled revenue growth and profits.""

JOBLESS CLAIMS TICKED UP BY 206,000

The rebound is real for smaller companies, but it is the biggest companies that have fared the best, a Wall Street Journal analysis of corporate financial data shows. For large-capitalization companies in the S&P 500 index, profits and revenue were hurt less by the pandemic’s initial economic slowdown. The biggest companies also rebounded more quickly than smaller ones, even as uncertainty deepened over Covid-19 infection rates and the spread of variants, rising inflation and supply-chain woes.

""The larger firms are able to navigate the supply-chain issues a lot easier,"" Ms. Bostjancic said. ""They have scale and additional resources that the medium-size to small-size firms are going to find more difficult.""

Sales

Companies in the S&P 500 range from clothing retailer Gap Inc., with a market value around $6.6 billion, to Apple Inc., which surged to a nearly $3 trillion market value. The median S&P 400 midcap company has a market value of about $5.7 billion, while the median S&P 600 small cap sports a $1.6 billion valuation, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence shows.

Total sales at all three groups in the most recently reported quarter are up from the comparable period in 2019—and profit growth has been even stronger, data from Refinitiv show.

Within those groups, of course, results vary widely. Looking at the past 12 months of reported financials, sales at a third of small-cap companies still trail 2019 levels, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Midsize and large companies were more likely to have surpassed that benchmark.

Sales at beauty-supply retailer Ulta Beauty Inc. have risen 12% in the 12 months ending this fall over 2019 levels. In 2020, the company had to shut many of its stores for weeks at a time and refocus more intensively on its online operations, Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten said.

Ulta emphasized self-care products over makeup and expanded augmented-reality features and a program to let customers pick up online orders outside its stores, he said. In-person sales bounced back quickly after its stores reopened in the summer, making up 70% of full-year 2020 sales, and have remained strong. Profit margins have also bounced back, to 10.7% in the 12 months that ended this fall, from 3.6% in the same period in 2020 and 9.7% in 2019, S&P data show.

""The results in 2021 have been extraordinary by any measure,"" Mr. Settersten said. ""People are coming back to the stores but they’re also continuing to shop digitally.""

Even some companies that have caught up are still feeling the pinch. Brink’s Co. , in S&P’s midcap index, made fewer stops with its iconic armored trucks, recording a 25% drop in revenue as the pandemic led businesses to shut down or scale back in April 2020, said CFO Ron Domanico.

In 2021, sales were recovering in those lines of business, growing about 3% a quarter, until the Delta variant slowed growth to about 1% a quarter this fall, Mr. Domanico said. Revenue has returned to about 96% of its pre-pandemic levels and the company doesn’t expect a full recovery until later in 2022.

Brink’s has more than made up for the slowdown in its pre-pandemic business with a series of acquisitions since early 2020. But the company’s costs are also rising with inflation and labor shortages.

""Just reading the tea leaves with what we’ve seen about inflation, I expect there will be another round of wage increases,"" Mr. Domanico added. ""And with our thin margins, we’re going to have to pass that on with price increases.""

INFLATION TAILWIND DRIVES S&P'S TOP STOCKS FOR 2021

Profit margins

Overall, 12-month profit margins are up for public companies since late 2019, even amid rising costs and the subsequent price increases. Here too, bigger companies are doing better.

Large-cap profit margins have long outstripped those of smaller companies. The decline in margins in 2020 was sharper for smaller firms as a group than it was for larger ones. The bigger companies also posted stronger margin growth over the last two years than small-caps.

The pandemic helped some businesses, sometimes in surprising ways. At water-meter maker Badger Meter Inc., a member of the S&P 600 index, revenues initially fell sharply in both its utility and commercial divisions with the onset of the pandemic.

But sales to utilities recovered the next quarter, and grew overall in 2020, offsetting drops in other business lines, said Karen Bauer, Badger’s treasurer and head of investor relations. For 2021, two acquisitions of water-quality monitoring companies helped.

Utility customers accelerated adoption of remote meter monitoring and other automation and digital services, which generate higher margins, increasing the company’s overall profitability, she said.

That helped push net-income margins to 11.5% for the 12 months ended in mid-December 2020, from 10.9% in the same period in 2019. The same dynamic continued in 2021, raising margins to 11.8% despite growing difficulty in securing electronic components and other supplies like packaging materials, the company said.

""We could have delivered more sales if not for the supply chain restraint,"" Ms. Bauer said.

Although smaller companies as a group trailed larger ones, Ms. Bauer said Badger’s smaller size proved to be an advantage over the past two years. After spotting problems in its resin supply chain, the company worked quickly to redesign products and raise prices, without multiple layers of decision-making to slow it down.

""Our agility and flexibility as a smaller company helped us see these challenges quicker and react to them perhaps faster than our larger peers,"" she said. ""You aren’t waiting for a monthly operations meeting.""

Debt and cash

Stung by the cash crunch that accompanied the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, many companies rushed to borrow when the pandemic hit in 2020. Large companies were able to borrow large amounts, issuing a median $123.6 million in debt in the 12 months ending in late 2020. The year before, they only issued $6.4 million. In 2021, they started paying it down, cutting debt by $24 million on average, according to data from FactSet.

Midcap companies borrowed in 2020 too, but to a much lesser degree, and they also used the past 12 months to reduce their debt overall. Midcaps increased their borrowing by a median of $1.4 million in 2020, according to debt-issuance data from FactSet, but their median debt load declined by a median $6.2 million in the past year.

The small-caps haven’t increased their debt issuance in the past three years, according to FactSet. Those companies slightly reduced their debt in 2019 and 2020, but cut it by a median $4 million in 2021.

Companies ""issued debt to ensure they had enough liquidity to survive for the next three, four, five years without tapping the debt markets if it wasn’t available,"" said Mr. Kloss, the portfolio manager for Brandywine.

Companies have started to pay back their debt and spend down their cash—a sign that they believe the worst of the pandemic is behind them, analysts said. Where cash and short-term investments on company balance-sheets spiked during the pandemic, it has begun to decline for large- and midcap companies.

""What’s been encouraging is that we’re seeing a rise in corporate [capital expenditures],"" said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist for investment manager Barings. ""Companies are not just buying back shares or returning money to shareholders, but they’re using it to reinvest in their business, maybe with M&A.""

Survivor bias

Missing from the Journal’s analysis: Companies that didn’t survive the pandemic intact, were acquired or which struggled and fell out of the indexes.

Bankruptcy filings—a measure of the most extreme corporate failure—among small and midsize public companies jumped in 2020, according to data from BankruptcyData, a division of New Generation Research Inc., which tracks bankruptcies by companies with public equity or debt.

There were far fewer such restructurings in 2021, with public companies on track to finish the year with about two-thirds as many bankruptcy filings as they had in 2019.

Among public companies with $100 million to $1 billion in revenue—similar to many companies in the S&P 600 index—there were 38 bankruptcies in 2020, more than double either of the previous two years.

Bankruptcies among companies with $1 billion to $10 billion in revenue—similar to many companies in the S&P 400 index—jumped to 29 in 2020 from just four in 2019.

They included car-rental company Hertz Corp. , fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy Corp. and luxury retailer Neiman Marcus, which had publicly traded debt. All three companies have since emerged from court protection.

Box Office Ends Year 60 Percent Behind 2019 With $4.5B Domestically,"Facing strong headwinds, domestic box office revenue rose to $4.5 billion in 2021 as the theatrical business struggled to recover from the COVID-19 crisis.

While that was up more than 101 percent over 2020, moviegoing still lagged far behind pre-pandemic levels.

According to Comscore, revenue for 2021 was nearly 60 percent behind 2019 ($11.4 billion). And the last time domestic revenue came in at $4.5 billion was 29 years ago — in 1992.

Both Comscore and the National Association of Theatre Owners note that the 60 percent revenue gap over 2019 is narrowed to roughly 40 percent when factoring in that many cinemas didn’t reopen until spring of 2021.

Final 2021 numbers for the foreign box office weren’t immediately available, but Comscore expects global revenue to come in at nearly $21 billion.

The box office recovery continues to be a slow process. The latest hurdle is the highly contagious omicron variant. The rise of streaming is also an enormous challenge for cinemas.

So far, younger moviegoers between ages 18 and 34 — and especially younger males — have fueled the recovery, resulting in superhero, action and horror dominating the top reaches of the yearly chart.

Look no further than year-end holiday blockbuster Spider-Man: No Way Home. The Sony and Marvel film will finish Sunday with more than $605 million in the bank domestically, and has already shattered numerous records, including becoming the first release of the pandemic era to earn more than $1 billion worldwide. And it was far and away the No. 1 film of 2021 in a huge win for Sony and the industry in general.

Superhero titles claimed five of the top 10 slots on the domestic chart, including the first four.

No Way Home led, followed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings ($224.5 million), Venom: Let There Be Carnage ($212.5 million) and Black Widow ($183.7 million).

F9: The Fast Saga, another male-fueled even pic, came in No. 5 domestically ($183.7 million), followed by superhero epic Eternals ($164.6 million), James Bond installment No Time to Die ($160.8 million), A Quiet Place Part II ($160.1 million) and Ghostbusters: Afterlife ($122 million).

Sleeper hit Free Guy rounded out the top 10 ($121.6 million).

For the first time in the modern era, there wasn’t a single animated title in the year’s box office top 10.

Families and older moviegoers have been more reluctant to return to cinemas, although families are beginning to show up in a significant way now that kids 5 and older can be vaccinated. (After No Way Home, Sing 2 was the hit of the 2021 Christmas season.)

Hollywood and theaters have yet to win back consumers who are 35 and older in a huge problem for adult-skewing fare such as West Side Story.

“One look at the Top 40 films of 2021 and it’s clear that those films with youth appeal are the ones that have fared best in theaters with the once elusive demographic group of 18- to 24-year-olds showing a clear willingness to hit the multiplex,” says Comscore’s Paul Dergarabedian. “The films that have youth appeal are indeed those that will help theaters weather the storm in the near term, but hopefully over time we will see the more mature demographic returning to cinemas and films devoted to this group not pushed to the side of the marquee.”",2022-01-01 18:54:44+00:00
16-year-old student athlete starts small business,"16-year-old student athlete starts small business

School and sports weren't enough to keep her busy! This Pennsylvania high school student is crafting and selling personal care products.

SPRINGFIELD, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- ""It is really just like a far-fetched idea to be, like, an entrepreneur at 16,"" said Bianca Brown. ""But I think you have to believe that you can do it yourself.""

The junior at Springfield High School had always enjoyed arts and crafts as a child. So, when her busy schedule was crossed out by the COVID-19 pandemic, Bianca looked to her past to design her future.

""During quarantine, I was really uncomfortable just doing nothing all day,"" she said. ""So, I started making, like, soaps and, like, new crafts and stuff.""

Bianca ordered ingredients and mixed them together to create uniquely-shaped soaps, colorful body butters, and dainty jewelry.

""I really could start a business doing this,"" she thought.

Thus, Bianca created SimplyB LLC, a beauty brand selling personal care products to friends and family at first. Through the use of the social media app, TikTok, Bianca was able to reach thousands and build a nationwide customer base.

""I literally woke up to 50 orders the next day,"" she said after her first video went viral. ""I don't even know how I really get all that done, to be honest with you.""

Bianca is among the busiest bees generating a buzz at her high school. She serves as treasurer on student council, plays varsity volleyball, runs track and field, and recently started a Black student union. Bianca is involved with the community service club and is also a part of the National Honor Society and the W.E.B. DuBois Honor Society.

With her high marks, it's clear that none of her academic responsibilities take a backseat to her small business. But still, Bianca succeeds as both a student and businesswoman.

""She literally runs the show and it is so, makes me so proud to sit and watch her do that,"" said Bianca's mother, Takia Brown.

Takia enjoys helping her daughter with the muscle work involved in her business, especially when stationed as a vendor at public events. She is Bianca's biggest fan.

"Staff, customers react to massive fire at Pharr business","Staff, customers react to massive fire at Pharr business

Firefighters from multiple agencies battled a blaze at a Pharr business on Saturday.

The public was advised to avoid the area of Matt's Building Materials - located on 404 E. Expressway 83 - as crews worked to extinguish the flames.

City spokeswoman Yuri Gonzalez said as of Saturday evening, the fire was 70% contained, but crews continued working to extinguish the fire overnight.

Multiple agencies responded in battling the fire at 11:30 a.m., including the Alamo Fire Department, Mission Fire Department and San Juan Fire Department.

No injuries have been reported, the city of Pharr said in a news release. Residents from nearby homes have been evacuated by police, Gonzalez said.

The following roads were closed due to the fire:

Panthers owner reportedly 'embarrassed' he gave 7-year contract to Matt Rhule,"The 2021 Carolina Panthers got off to a promising 3-0 start, but after winning just two of their next 12 games, reports of discord and even ""embarrassment"" are starting to emerge.

According to The Athletic's Joseph Person, Panthers owner David Tepper feels a lot of regret about giving head coach Matt Rhule a massive contract when he was hired in 2020.

Rhule was hired in Carolina in 2020 after overseeing quick turnarounds at Temple and Baylor, but sources say owner David Tepper is unhappy and embarrassed after the $16 billion hedge fund manager gave Rhule a seven-year, $62 million deal to outbid the New York Giants for his services.

Embarrassment is pretty much the last emotion a head coach wants his owner to feel. However, Person also reported that Tepper isn't ready to fire Rhule yet, and will give him a third year to right the ship.

But there are a lot of issues for Rhule to fix, and most, if not all, start with him. He reportedly micromanages “everything that touches football,” and assembled a staff with no experience as NFL assistants or coordinators. Some players have started doubting his ""process,"" which thus far hasn't led to visible results or any sustained success.

Panthers are a 'clusterf***'

According to Person, one Panthers source called Rhule's second year as head coach a ""clusterf***,"" and it's hard to argue that word doesn't fit the 2021 Panthers. Their regression from 2020 has been pretty stark. Via The Athletic:

The Panthers were more competitive in 2020, when they finished 5-11 with [Teddy] Bridgewater at quarterback. Carolina lost six games in 2020 by 7 points or fewer, compared to three this year. Their average margin of defeat in ’20 was 9.2 points; this year the Panthers have lost by an average of 13.7 points.

The defense, which is second in the league in yards allowed, has been a bright spot. But even that is losing its luster, with the defense getting worn down over time — especially since they're on the field so much due to issues with the offense.

Story continues

And the offense definitely has issues. The Panthers gave up three draft picks for Sam Darnold last offseason and immediately picked up his fifth-year option. But getting Darnold away from the self-immolating New York Jets didn't result in overwhelming success. It hasn't helped that their offensive line is leaky and star running back Christian McCaffrey has been absent for half the season.

Darnold fractured his scapula in Week 9, which led to the signing of former star QB Cam Newton. A promising first game led to more disappointment: Newton lost all five games he started, and now a healthy Darnold has been tapped as the Panthers' Week 17 starter.

The Panthers have problems on every side of the football, and now they have an owner who is reportedly unhappy with the team's direction, and also ""embarrassed"" by the contract he gave his head coach. If Rhule can't figure out how to get the Panthers to visibly improve in 2022, Tepper's patience is almost guaranteed to run out and and Rhule will get a one-way ticket out of town.",None
Michigan vs. Georgia results: Stetson Bennett’s 3 TDs lead Bulldogs to blowout win in CFP semifinal,"The College Football Playoff National Championship Game will be an SEC championship game rematch.

No. 3 Georgia established early that it was more than capable of bouncing back from a stinging conference championship loss to Alabama, opening up a 17-point lead against No. 2 Michigan.

The matchup only got worse from there. Georgia added two more touchdowns to complete a 34-11 rout in the Orange Bowl on Friday. The Bulldogs outgained the Wolverines 515-325.

Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett completed 21 of 31 passes for 307 yards and three touchdowns.

BENDER: Alabama, Saban flex the old-fashioned way in blowout of Cincinnati

Georgia began the game on offense and took just 4:11 to drive 80 yards, capped by a 9-yard touchdown pass from Bennett to Brock Bowers.

Michigan couldn’t respond on the ensuing drive, and Georgia came right back with another scoring drive, this one ending on a trick play. Running back Kenny McIntosh found Adonai Mitchell on an 18-yard pass to make it 14-0 in the first quarter.

Two Georgia field goals and a Michigan field goal later, the Bulldogs added another touchdown when Bennett found Jermaine Burton down the right sideline for a 57-yard scoring pass to extend the Bulldogs' advantage to 27-3 at the half.

Both teams were quiet in the third quarter before Bennett threw his third touchdown pass of the night, a 39-yarder to James Cook in the fourth quarter to make the score 34-3. Michigan (12-2) didn't score a touchdown until 4:25 remained in the game when J.J. McCarthy found Andrel Anthony for a 35-yard scoring pass. An end-around on a 2-point conversion brought the score to 34-11.

"Alabama vs. Cincinnati score, Cotton Bowl takeaways: Tide roll into sixth College Football Playoff title game","ARLINGTON, Texas -- No. 1 Alabama rolled through No. 4 Cincinnati 27-6 behind a monster day from running back Brian Robinson Jr. The redshirt senior rushed for an Alabama bowl record 204 yards on 26 carries to deliver the Crimson Tide a 2021 Cotton Bowl semifinal win and their sixth appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship.

Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Bryce Young threw for just 181 yards against Cincinnati's elite pass defense, but he tossed three touchdown passes to as many different receivers. Young broke program records for both single-season yards passing and passing touchdowns in his first game since winning the Heisman.

The Tide put together an 11-play scoring drive -- featuring 10 rushes -- on their first possession to set the tone for the game. The Bearcats managed to get into the red zone three times, but they settled for field goals twice and turned the ball over on downs once against the most vaunted dynasty in college football history.

Cincinnati managed to compile just 72 yards in the first half, the fewest in any half in College Football Playoff history. Cincy played better in the second half to end the game with 218 total yards, but it still averaged just 3.8 yards per play. Quarterback Desmond Ridder struggled mightily, completing just 17-of-32 passes for 144 yards. Running back Jerome Ford had 77 yards but only got 15 attempts in the game.

Need more college football in your life? Listen below and subscribe to the Cover 3 Podcast where we break down Alabama's rout of Cincinnati in the Cotton Bowl.

Alabama has now won all six matchups against Cincinnati in their combined history, though the teams had not played since 1990. The Tide await either No. 2 Michigan or No. 3 Georgia in the CFP National Championship on Jan. 10, 2022.

With Alabama moving on to the national championship, let's unpack all that took place on New Year's Eve in Arlington.

1. Brian Robinson Jr. met the moment

Against the No. 2 pass defense in college football, Alabama decided to turn back the clock and win with pure physicality. Robinson rose to the occasion in that effort, putting together the best performance of his career. The redshirt senior was dominant and bruising with 204 yards on 26 rushing attempts. Though Robinson didn't reach the end zone, he was the centerpiece of the Crimson Tide's offense on Friday.

Robinson has been somewhat of a forgotten man in Alabama's backfield, but at 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds, he was the perfect player for this moment. His effort meant that Young's somewhat pedestrian numbers were complementary, not a hinderance, as the Crimson Tide kept the offense moving. Alabama has beaten teams over the top with its vertical passing attack all season long, but Robinson proved he can be a game-changing playmaker if called upon.

2. Cincinnati's offense did not

There was optimism leading up to the Cotton Bowl that Cincinnati could generate offense because of its experienced signal-caller. Ridder came into Friday's matchup with more than double the number of career pass attempts of Young, but he struggled to keep the Bearcats on schedule.

The senior completed 53% of his passes and averaged 4.5 yards per pass attempt. Few of his passes went further than 10 yards downfield and the Bearcats averaged just 8.5 yards per completion. Alabama's secondary struggled at times this season and the Tide were without starting cornerback Josh Jobe. This defense was asking to be challenged downfield, Cincinnati failed to rise to the occasion.

It wasn't all Ridder's fault, of course. Cincinnati's offensive line struggled to block all night and Ridder's receivers did not do him many favors in creating separation. Still, Ridder could have been a wild card in this game. He was able to create a couple of individual plays with his legs -- something that did not appear to be a focal point of the Bearcats' offensive effort. As a result, the passing game was a weakness.

3. Alabama's front remains fearsome

Early in the game, it became clear that Cincinnati was effectively ceding its offensive line to Alabama. The Bearcats did a decent job, at first, of forcing playmakers like Anderson and defensive end Phidarian Mathis into uncomfortable situations, but the dam eventually broke.

Anderson posted six tackles and two sacks in key moments, while Mathis added two tackles for loss and a sack. The Crimson Tide sacked the mobile Ridder six times, broke up six passes and batted down four balls (Ridder had just five batted down all season long). Alabama's defense has been a work in progress for much of the season, but the Tide have found a rotation that caused the Bearcats all kinds of problems.

4. Cincinnati's pass defense is for real

While the game ended up being a three-score blowout, Cincinnati's pass defense mucked up the game and made life difficult for Young. Defensive lineman Myjai Sanders earned five pressures while cornerbacks Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner and Coby Bryant were hardly targeted. Two of Alabama's red-zone touchdown passes were against linebackers, while the breakaway pass to Ja'Corey Brooks came against a safety.

All three prospective NFL Draft picks deserve praise for holding star Crimson Tide receiver Jameson Williams to just 62 yards receiving and 8.9 yards per catch. Gardner ended his career without allowing a single career touchdown catch. In every way, Cincinnati's pass defense held up its end of the bargain.

5. National title contenders

Alabama has primarily ridden the arm of Young this season, including his 421-yard, three-touchdown performance in the SEC Championship Game. However, Nick Saban proved that his team is still comfortable being uncomfortable and finding ways to win.

When playing against the best teams in the nation, it's the team that can absorb punches and keep running that often wins the national championship. After playing downfield football against No. 3 Georgia, physical football against No. 4 Cincinnati and grind-it-out football against Auburn, the Crimson Tide are prepared for anything the national title game will throw at them.

Alabama was a rare underdog in the SEC title. They'll be slight dogs again (+2.5) vs. the Bulldogs in the CFP National Championship, but that is hardly an indicator of this team's potential to win yet another national title.",None

Anyone who receives a positive result on their COVID-19 test should stay home until cleared by their local public health department, and we encourage you to transfer your tickets to someone who meets the proof of vaccination or negative test requirement. If you have been cleared by your local health department and have received a release letter dated within the last 90 days, you will be allowed entry using that documentation.



I purchased tickets under the guidance that no negative testing or vaccination status would be needed. Now that that policy has changed, I am not interested in attending. Can I get a refund?

All tickets purchased require compliance with Michigan Athletics policies. These policies are always subject to change. While some ticket holders may not be vaccinated, we are not barring any guests from attending events. Additionally, any ticket holder may transfer tickets to others who wish to attend or resell them through Stubhub.



What does vaccination mean?

Michigan Athletics' current vaccination requirement is at least 14 days after your second dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (or other COVID-19 vaccinations recognized by WHO) or at least 14 days after your single dose of the Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine. This definition will continue to be updated under the U-M vaccination policy.



With a required vaccine or negative test, is it still required to wear a mask inside Michigan Athletic events?

Face masks continue to be required and must be worn during all home indoor athletic events. Failure to comply may result in being asked to leave the event.



I have a vaccine waiver from the University of Michigan. Does this policy apply to me?

All guests ages 12 and older will be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR or rapid test taken within 72 hours of the event. If you have a vaccine waiver as a current student/faculty/staff member, you will be required to display the ResponsiBLUE app to confirm compliance with the UM COVID-19 vaccination requirement.



The University of Michigan recommended that no food or beverages be made available during indoor events. Will concession stands be open at games? If so, will there be restrictions on where guests can consume food and beverage items?

Concession stands will remain open at this time, and guests will be allowed to consume food and beverage in their seats and other designated areas with the expectation that face masks will continue to be required and must be worn unless immediately eating or drinking. U-M officials will continue to monitor the spread of the delta and omicron variants and adapt health and safety strategies accordingly.



How long is this policy in effect?

The changes remain in effect until further notice. Future changes will be communicated as they become known.",None
WNBA legend Becky Hammon leaving Spurs to become head coach of Las Vegas Aces,"WNBA legend Becky Hammon is returning to the league to become the head coach of the Las Vegas Aces, the team announced. Multiple teams had made offers to lure Hammon away from the NBA, where she's been an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs since 2014.

""We're very excited to have Becky return to the Aces' franchise as our head coach,"" Aces president Nikki Fargas said. ""Her success in the sport of basketball as both a player and a coach is unparalleled, and fueled by a tenacious desire to be the best she can possibly be. We have one of the most talented rosters in the WNBA, and Becky is the absolute best person to lead this team.""

Hammon is expected to finish the NBA season with the Spurs. Their final regular-season game is set for April 10, and they are currently in 10th place in the Western Conference, which means a deep playoff run is unlikely. It's possible that Hammon could miss a portion of training camp with the Aces, but she should be done with her NBA responsibilities well before WNBA opening day on May 6.

It is not surprising that Hammon has finally become a head coach -- she's been up for multiple NBA jobs over the past few years, and was reportedly a finalist for the Portland Trail Blazers' gig last summer -- but no one expected her to take over in Vegas. First and foremost, there wasn't a vacancy. Bill Laimbeer had been the head coach of the Aces since 2018, and there were no expectations he was going to leave. (He could now reportedly take a front-office position with the club.)

In addition, there were multiple WNBA teams still looking for a new coach this offseason, including the New York Liberty. Hammon spent the first eight seasons of her playing career with the Liberty, making three All-Star Games and one All-WNBA Team as she helped the team to three Finals appearances.

The Aces, though, decided to make a push for Hammon and were able to get the deal over the finish line by offering a five-year contract that will make her the highest-paid coach in the WNBA, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Hammon, who did play for the Aces franchise when they were the San Antonio Silver Stars, will also get a chance to coach one of the most talented rosters in the league.

A'ja Wilson, the 2020 MVP and one of the league's best young playes, is a restricted free agent, but she'll surely be back. As will veteran point guard Chelsea Gray, reigning Sixth Player of the Year Kelsey Plum, two-time Sixth Player of the Year Dearica Hamby and former No. 1 overall pick Jackie Young. The Aces will also have big decisions to make about free agents Liz Cambage, Angel McCoughtry and Riquna Williams.

But regardless of what they do about the latter three, the Aces will enter 2022 with high expectations. They've made it to at least the semifinals three seasons in a row, but have just one Finals appearance and zero trophies to show for it. Hammon will hope she's the coach who can help them break through and claim the first championship in franchise history.

Along with the personnel decisions Hammon and Co. make this winter, it will be fascinating to see what sort of play style she implements. There have been plenty of complaints about Laimbeer's old-school, inside-out style that had the Aces looking more like his 1990s ""Bad Boys"" Detroit Pistons than a modern offense. The Aces were last in the league in 3-point attempts in all four of Laimbeer's seasons, and they often struggled to score in the playoffs when the competition improved.

Hammon was a high-volume 3-point shooter in her day and has just spent nearly a decade learning from Gregg Popovich in San Antonio. It's easy to envision a future where the Aces let Cambage walk in free agency and build a more perimeter-based offense that emphasizes ball movement, highlights Gray and Plum and utilizes Wilson as the lone big.",None
Ralf Rangnick: Man Utd more than just Cristiano Ronaldo-Bruno Fernandes partnership,"Ralf Rangnick has played down the importance of Cristiano Ronaldo's partnership with Bruno Fernandes and says Manchester United must ""develop as a whole team"".

Questions have been raised over whether Ronaldo and Fernandes can play effectively together at both Portugal and United, in spite of their individual abilities.

Speaking on Monday Night Football, Gary Neville described the duo as ""whingebags"" following United's disappointing 1-1 draw away at Newcastle United, criticising the body language of two of Rangnick's senior players.

Fernandes has scored five goals and made six assists in the Premier League, slightly fewer than at the same stage last term, while Ronaldo tapped in his 14th goal of the season against Burnley on Thursday.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Gary Neville criticised Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo for negative body language once again during the 1-1 draw with Newcastle.

Rangnick insists his principal focus is on improving the chemistry and understanding of the team as a whole and not on the attacking partnership between Fernandes and Ronaldo.

""Against Burnley, we had to play without Bruno and again we did well, we played with two strikers, two wingers, two No 6s, every player in his best possible position,"" he told Sky Sports News.

Live MNF

""This is another thing we are trying to achieve, no matter which formation we are trying to play we have every player in his best possible position. So it is not only about the partnership between Cristiano and Bruno, it is about partnerships between other players.

""Yesterday it was about a partnership between Edinson [Cavani] and Cristiano and it worked well. Edinson was the player with the highest distance in the whole team.

""Since we will change the team and starting line-up every game it is about different partnerships and developing the whole team, and they should play with the same mindset and principles when we are in possession of the ball or when the other team is in possession.""

'Too early to think about January transfers'

Rangnick says it is ""too early"" to be thinking about transfers ahead of the January window and there is enough competition for first-team places in his squad.

Anthony Martial could yet move away from Old Trafford next month despite United rejecting a loan offer from Sevilla for the forward, while speculation continues to surround Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard's futures at the club with the pair's contracts expiring at the end of the campaign.

But it remains to be seen whether United will add to their squad, despite them being reportedly linked with a number of targets including Paris Saint-Germain forward Mauro Icardi and Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.

United invested heavily on trio Raphael Varane (£41m), Jadon Sancho (£73m), and Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m) during the previous window, but Rangnick has indicated the club may be less busy in January.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player FREE TO WATCH: Highlights from Manchester United's win against Burnley in the Premier League.

When asked about any potential transfer activity next month, Rangnick told Sky Sports News: ""[It's] too early now. The current squad is big enough, with a lot of competition in the squad.

""To speak about future players coming into the club doesn't make sense at this stage when we have to find out which player is in which position, the best possible solution for every game.

""Right now for me, it doesn't make sense to think about future players. My full focus is on the current squad and to find for each game the best possible formation and line-up.""

Image: Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane signed for United last summer

Having become accustomed to life at Old Trafford and Carrington after one month in his interim role, Rangnick says man-management will be a key part of his position like it is for managers at other top Premier League clubs.

He added: ""This is always about man management, having a good relationship with the players. But also be aware that you're the one to take the decisions.

""Who is going to play, who will be substituted, who will be on the bench or possibly not even make it into the squad for the next game.""

England players should not miss international duty to play in IPL: Michael Atherton,"The English cricketers should not miss international duty at the expense of playing in the IPL, former England captain Michael Atherton has said in the wake of the team’s disastrous Ashes campaign in Australia.

England have already conceded the five-match series Down Under against their traditional rivals after suffering heavy defeats in the first three Tests, the poor show attracting widespread criticism from former players.

“Players should not miss international duty to play in the IPL, nor be rested and rotated to allow them to play elsewhere. The carry-on during the winter, and at the start of the English summer, should not happen again,” Atherton wrote in his column for ‘The Times’.

With regards to the glitzy IPL, the former captain also had other suggestions to help improve England’s performance in the international arena’s red-ball format.

“The leading multi-format players are paid seven-figure sums, but, incredibly, the ECB washes its hands of them for two months of the year during the Indian Premier League.

“The players should be told that, while the ECB will be accommodating of the request to play in the IPL, a 12-month contract is exactly that, and the granting of a no-objection certificate to play in the IPL and other franchised competitions is contingent on it being in the best interests of the England team,” Atherton said.

Atherton, who has captained England in 54 Tests from 1993 to 2001, felt Ben Stokes is a “viable alternative” to replace Joe Root as skipper for the five-day format.

Root, who had a magnificent run with the bat in 2021, has been under the scanner for his captaincy in Australia.

“There have been so many errors here, from selection to strategy, that the captain has to bear personal responsibility … This could have been a much closer series had Root got things right on the field,” Atherton wrote.

“Root has been a good England captain, and has always carried himself superbly and is an incredible ambassador for the sport, but having done the job for five years and having had three cracks at the Ashes, including two awful campaigns in Australia, it is time for someone else to have a go.

“Ben Stokes is a viable alternative, having done an excellent job as a stand-in briefly in the summer. His bowling is starting to wind down, and, as he may not get into England’s best T20 side now, he can be given a breather during those matches,” Atherton added.

As far as head coach Chris Silverhood is concerned, Atherton said it’s time he is shown the door.

“At the moment there seems to be an absence of authority and an unwillingness to challenge the players.

“There is no way Silverwood will (or should) survive the Ashes, which should allow a reorganisation of the coaching and selecting responsibilities.”

The fourth Test begins in Sydney on January 5.",2022-01-01 17:57:24+05:30
"Looking ahead, what 2022 can potentially unveil in sport","Just as we thought sport could return to its days of relaxed intensity, the virus has crept back into reckoning and wrecking of schedules. Express reporters list out their wishes for what 2022 can potentially unveil in sport, while keeping fingers crossed, hoping matters of life and health don’t again get calamitous.

Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!”

Bill Murray’s hyperbole in Ghostbusters may very well have been about the uneasy marriage of video games and ‘Big Sport’. Esports makes its debut at Asian Games this September. And many are expecting sparks to fly between the perceived monoliths of ‘get-off-my-lawn boomers’ and ‘I’m-allergic-to-grass-anyway zoomers’. Realistically, it will come, and pass.

Esports is an established industry with no need for legitimacy. And expecting the Twitch-watching crowd to magically switch to the Asian Games (and, in future, the Olympics) is expecting the bustling pizzeria to go bankrupt because the buffet next door has thrown slices of Margherita in the mix.

Not what or why, the intrigue is in the who. The historic first batch of Asiad gamers. The Asian stars who left their homes to live in cyber cafes, ingesting chips and soda and racking up kills all through the night. Closer home, the gamers who are still confused for online gamblers, who have had tournaments spoilt by power cuts. A few of them will suddenly find themselves atop a podium, adding to the country’s tally, doing their best medal bites. How cool would that be?

Wanted: Air fresheners with freshly-cut grass scent

One of my unforgettable days at cricket was at Newlands in Cape Town on the 2019 tour. Watching Rohit Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara face Steyn and Philander sitting square of the wicket on the hill with the Amla Army – the laughing, singing boys and girls with fake beards and floppy hats – was a riot. You could see bowlers bending their backs, batsmen going up on their heels, the balls screaming past their noses, the slip cordon letting out a loud ‘ohh’ and those on the banks lending chorus. Catching live sports from home is a sad substitute for the stadium experience. Don’t trust the broadcaster, television can never give you any idea about the speed of a cricket ball, the urgency of a busy football mid-field, the power of a baseline winner, the brutality of a shuttler’s smash or the fury of an F1 race. You can be a zoom meeting fan and relish WFH but please don’t get used to being a ‘Watch From Home’ fan. Pray the virus gets cornered and killed in 2022 and the beaming fans once again race through the turnstiles. The cricket season will soon start and we will be stuck at home. Do they have air fresheners with freshly cut grass fragrance?

Year of the successor?

In May 2019, the morning after he’d led Mumbai Indians to their fourth IPL trophy, I asked Rohit Sharma what he felt about calls for him to get the India white-ball captaincy. He’d just become the country’s most successful T20 franchise captain. “That is not in my hands… that is for you guys to judge, whether I am prepared or not,” he’d said. In his own mind, he has possibly been prepared for a long time. He will certainly bring the rigour of analytical planning to the job, plus that instinctive ‘feel’ for limited-overs cricket. These are givens. What we are going to find out is how he will handle the great batsman who was controversially dumped as ODI captain, and who is still racking up big away wins as Test captain. And whether India will do better at the 2022 T20 World Cup than they did in 2021. And, of course, how Rohit’s iffy fitness will hold up.

BYOB … the Dukes, if you will

BYOB is the wish for the 2022. Not the booze, but the ball. For once, it would be great if bowlers are given the choice at toss on what type of ball they are going to use in the game. If India wants Dukes to be used in Australia – an eternal moan of sorts from R Ashwin and the pacers – they can go with it. Australia can choose Kookaburra. It won’t be a level-playing field on paper but it actually is a better leveller than the norm. James Anderson can try his best – surely he is going to continue to play for another decade- swinging the Dukes in Australia. If Australia find the extra seam on the SG ball though, they can go with Kookaburra in India. Let the captains announce their decision at the toss – it adds to the drama and the spectacle too. BYOB, please!

I have both excitement and apprehension about the World Cup in Qatar late in 2022. Excitement because it’s just the second time in 91 years of the event’s history that it travels to Asia, and the first in the Middle East. Football-crazy as this part of the world is, there would doubtless be glittering quality and competitiveness. Arguably two of the finest-ever, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal is yet to qualify, and I wish they don’t at the expense of Italy), will bid their international farewell.Can one of them wrap up their career with their El Dorado?

There is a looming spectre of scrutiny as well, about how a conservative country could accommodate activism, alcohol and LGBTQ+ rights. However, Qatar has maintained it will comply with Fifa rules promoting tolerance and inclusion at matches, and that it is a “traditional but friendly” country. It would even allow fans to drink, whether they would be allowed to do so in public has to be seen. Questions could be raised on alleged human rights violations as well.

Time to join 90m club

An Asian, Commonwealth and Olympics medal at his first shot, Neeraj Chopra is already a living legend no matter what transpires from here on. But by his own admission, the Olympic gold “is in its place” and what he should aspire is to now to breach the magical 90m mark. Neeraj’s 87.58m gold-winning Tokyo throw does not even feature in his own top three career throws. Johannes Vetter, his German rival, on the other hand has breached the 90m mark an unbelievable 17 times. Now that Neeraj has attainted the pinnacle of athletics glory, it only makes sense for him to join the 90m club teeming with Germans. With several big competitions lined up this year including the World Championships at Eugene in 2022, Neeraj should all but focus on adding those couple of metres. Obviously, it’s easier said than done but then Neeraj loves challenges to better his 88.07m.

Birmingham, Hangzhou dress rehearsals

For me, the biggest anticipation of the year 2022 will be the emergence of new talents in the Birmingham Commonwealth Games and Hangzhou Asian Games. When the likes of Neeraj Chopra or Vinesh Phogat won twin medals in the 2018 CWG and Asian Games, it marked their arrival at the world stage before they were counted among top medal prospects for Tokyo. I see the likes of 14-year-old shooter Namya Kapoor winning a medal in CWG or Asian Games and what it could do to their confidence and preparations for Paris 2024. I will also be looking to athletes and teams to get their plans on track for Paris with the CWG as well Asian Games. I am hopeful of the Indian men’s hockey team booking a direct spot for Paris winning the title in Huangzhou. I will also be anticipating wrestler Vinesh Phogat, shooter Saurabh Chaudhary and boxer Amit Panghal to once again dominate Asia in their journey to glory in Paris, a chance which they missed in Tokyo.

Board for Cricket Communication in India

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is always in the news and one always expects the richest board to communicate regularly and professionally. The year 2021 has been one where there has been lack of communication from the Indian board, not only with its players but with its stakeholders too. Going forward in 2022, one will anticipate some better flow of information available. The BCCI hasn’t yet formally announced who the Indian team support staff is and what their tenure will be.

There has been not a single press release on VVS Laxman’s appointment and how long he will be with the National Cricket Academy. Or who has replaced the India under 19 coach for the Asia Cup?

It took some Twitter outrage to get the BCCI to post a tweet on Virat Kohli’s contribution to Indian cricket as ODI captain. The BCCI selection committee doesn’t talk anymore, no one knows why they make the decisions they have taken before picking the Indian team or a particular player. Clear communication ought to be BCCI’s 2022 goal.

Title ambitions for women’s cricket

Relegated to the fringes of public consciousness, 2022 would provide an opportunity for women’s cricket to test how far they have progressed. India reached the final of the previous edition of the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2017, losing narrowly to England. Since then, they’ve reached the summit clash of the T20 World Cup before the pandemic played havoc with the schedule. The national team has played only sporadically, but key players like Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana and Jemima Rodrigues have excelled in the Women’s Big Bash in Australia. They would be key when India travel to New Zealand early next year.

Also, there is the return of the sport at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham where a high-standard field is likely to test them.

England and Australia are traditional powerhouses in women’s cricket, and have an almost exclusive hold on the game’s biggest prizes. The year 2022 may indicate whether India can finally join the exclusive club.

Shoot at site

Late in 2022, Indian shooters will get an opportunity to assess where they stand. This comes after a disastrous Tokyo Olympics showing. One that saw a record number of Indians qualify for the Games but only one shooter in Saurabh Chaudhary, managing to qualify for the finals, where he came 7th.

Advertisement

I think World Championships are one of the best indicators of Olympic preparedness. Primarily because the best in the world compete in these events and the scores are often a better indicator of where a shooter stands. An average of scores collected in and around the tournament are likelier to reflect the calibre and form of a shooter, than other meets or in some cases, even World Cups. Shooters that do well next October should ideally be given the right kind of backing and training in the following 20 months till July 2024 when the Paris Games begin.

Sophomore challenges for women’s hockey

They scripted one of the biggest surprises – and also one of the most heartwarming stories – at the Tokyo Olympics but 2022 might well turn out to be a year of reckoning for the women’s hockey team.

Advertisement

Under new coach Janneke Schopman, Rani Rampal & Co. will compete in three major events in as many months, starting with the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Spain and the Netherlands from July 1 to 17.

Eleven days after it ends, the team will travel to Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games and a month later, they’ll be in Hangzhou for the Asian Games, where a berth for the Paris Games will be for grabs.

It’ll be interesting to see how Schopman, who was the team’s assistant coach in Tokyo, juggles the workload in a packed year, where the team will also play the FIH Pro League and the Asia Cup in January, where the top four teams will earn World Cup qualification. The three-month period from July to September, however, will be defining for them, and a chance to show that the semifinal appearance at the Olympics wasn’t a flash in the pan.

Will Winter Olympians protest?

The United States, Australia, Britain and Japan are among countries that have announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics because of allegations of China’s atrocities against the Uyghur community. Former World No.1 doubles player Peng Shuai’s disappearance from public space, after she accused a top government official of sexual assault, has raised concerns about her safety. The WTA withdrew its events from China in a rare stand taken by a sports body against a powerful government. Now the ball is in the court of Winter Olympians, set to participate in the Games in February. Politicians of certain countries not attending the games wouldn’t give China too much heartburn. However, if an athlete or a group of athletes decide to ‘express their views’ through a gesture or a message on a mask, it would leave the organisers in a fix. An attempt to cock a snook at the authoritarian regime in the People’s Republic of China will require a brave athlete to step up for Human Rights in one of the most inhospitable countries for activists.

WC every two years = split in FIFA

The real danger is that an idea as stupid as a biennial World Cup can transform into a reality, for Fifa falls for quantity at the expense of quality. One of the reasons why Qatar will host a football World Cup in 2022 is that they had the support of the majority of Fifa members, while strong and traditional football powers gasped for vote.

The proposal for a biennial World Cup has been put forward by Arsene Wenger, now Fifa’s head of global development, to improve competitive chances for smaller nations, and eventually if it is put to vote, also-rans will outnumber the elite. No chance that Uefa will accept it. They have their Euros and a biennial World Cup will clash with that. It will have an adverse effect on the top leagues and the Champions League as well. Football is played in Europe and this idea reeks of damaging the continent’s football economy. Think there’s a decent chance of a breakaway if Fifa doesn’t address Uefa’s concerns. Circa 2022 could be a year of ferment.

The Young Force Awakens

In front of a star-studded line-up of Hollywood royalty, a piece of history remained incomplete at the men’s US Open final. Novak Djokovic’s Calendar Slam dream came to a shuddering halt courtesy a tall Russian, Daniil Medvedev. But in that defeat a new chapter had begun in the story of tennis. This was the first step in the transition from the Golden Era of the Big 3 to the Time of the NextGen.

In the fifth Grand Slam final where one from the younger guard would face either Rafael Nadal or Djokovic, Medvedev broke through.

After all these years that Federer, Nadal and Djokovic – with 60 Grand Slams between them – have reinvented themselves, you feel the NextGen has found the formula to break the Big 3 oligopoly. That’s what I’m looking forward to seeing in 2022 – whether the youngsters can consolidate the transition to a new world order.

But, but…it’s the All England..

With her recent focus and necessity of picking and choosing tournaments, the All England, a Super 1000 like three others, isn’t necessarily a shoo-in on PV Sindhu’s schedule. It’s not even a must-have on her wall of fame, given all she’s achieved. But the All E remains an emotional hook for Indian shuttlers, given no Indian woman has ever won the title. It took 21 years after Prakash Padukone for Pullela Gopichand to win at Birmingham. It’s been another 21 years, as India continues searching for a winner. It’s not the Everest, but I’d like to see Sindhu ambitiously target that K2 peak and go all-out for the All-E, and go past the legends.

Sindhu has two Olympic medals, a World Championship (besides 4 other medals), and as such can safely stake a claim to India’s greatest Olympic sport athlete. But the All England isn’t a box that she will want staying un-checked in her career, given this could be her 10th outing at the circuit staple (she was out injured in 2015) since first playing in 2012. All top players of this vintage (Marin, Okuhara, Tai Tzu and Chen Yufei) – except Ratchanok and Yamaguchi – have won the All E atleast once. Saina Nehwal hasn’t either. So, Sindhu must.

The 20-year-old Delhi sprinter has been one of the country’s best performing youngsters in 2021.

She won gold in 100m and 200m races in the National U-23 Championships from September 27-29 here, clocking 11.54secs and 23.57secs — her personal best — respectively.

Just a week before that, she won 100m gold in the National Open Championships with a personal best time of 11.50secs as well as 200m silver (23.64secs) though many top athletes skipped the meet as it was held after the Tokyo Olympics towards the end of the season.

“Yes, Taranjeet Kaur failed an in-competition test conducted by the NADA,” a source privy to the development told PTI on condition of anonymity.

The name and nature of the banned drug as-well-as the competition during which the dope sample was taken could not be ascertained.

The in-competition test could have been taken either during the National U-23 Championships or the National Open Championships, both held in September.

Returning to a sport after injury is a mental game. Here’s how to do it.,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

“I was airborne. I was falling off the edge of a cliff. I felt the first impact, then the second, then the third.” That was how professional ultrarunner and endurance athlete Hillary Allen, who had been dubbed “Hillygoat” for her effortless speed running uphill, described falling 150 feet off a ridge at one of the hardest ultrarunning races in the world, the Tromso Skyrace in Norway in August 2017. Airlifted to a hospital, she had broken 14 bones, including a badly sprained ankle and a serious rupture of a foot ligament, and suffered a concussion and lacerations.

Ten months later, Allen, 33, was back at the start line.

Her recovery went far beyond surgeries and physical therapy.

“In an instant I had gone from being extremely fit and capable to utterly dependent,” she writes in “Out and Back: A Runner’s Story of Survival Against All Odds.” “Not being able to run was devastating and the fear surrounding my return was debilitating, but also forced me to take it easy, look at situations differently, and seek out new ways to engage with myself.”

Three years before Allen’s near-death fall, swimmer Mallory Weggemann, 32, was preparing for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro when a shower seat broke under her at a hotel, leaving her left arm with permanent nerve damage.

This was especially devastating because Weggemann, who had broken 34 American records and won gold and bronze medals at the 2012 London Paralympics, had already made a years-long comeback. A swimmer all her life, at 18 she became paralyzed from the abdomen down after an epidural injection to treat back pain.

“When you look at the athletic journey and the ups and downs that come with it, it’s not all world records and gold medals,” Weggemann said. She chronicles this journey in “Limitless: The Power of Hope and Resilience to Overcome Circumstance.”

She wrote: “How do you return after those setbacks? The catastrophic injury to my arm brought me to the depths in a way that not even my paralysis did. And then it was ‘Now how do I return to not only this thing that I love but also is part of my identity and my career?’ ”

Allen, too, said that her devastating injuries led her to reevaluate what running meant to her and how she was going to approach healing from a mental perspective, in addition to all the physical rehabilitation and surgeries she would undergo.

It’s not just elite athletes with life-changing injuries who have to confront the insecurity and fear of returning to the start line, whether it’s on foot, on a bike or in the pool. Anyone who has twisted an ankle while running or has had a bad fall on a bike or on a trail run knows what it’s like to be injured and unable to do a sport.

But there are ways of training your mind and spirit and recalibrating your expectations to ease the fear and insecurity of returning to your sport, and enlarge your appreciation of it.

Address your fears

“We have to recognize that mental stress plays a real role in predisposing an athlete to injury,” said Stephen P. Gonzalez, an assistant athletic director for leadership and mental performance at Dartmouth College. “If we have high levels of fear or anxiety returning subconsciously, we are sending signals from the brain to the body that just are stiffening and tightening and bracing one for impact. And all that does is just predispose you to be more injury susceptible.”

Gonzalez helps athletes understand their mental response to injuries with the metaphor of a windup toy.

“Every time you have so much fear and you can’t let yourself know that that’s okay and play fluidly and all you’re doing is turning and turning and turning the key, eventually you’re so tight that you can’t absorb impact,” he said.

Fear and anxiety are protective emotions, Gonzalez said. He said that often people worry about a possible future event, and “we’re not anxious about anything other than the actual act of being anxious,” he said. “And so getting them to really take a step back and say, ‘All right, let’s actually take a look at some things. You’re nervous. But what is the evidence against feeling the way that you feel right now?’ ”

This mental exploration where athletes can reassure themselves with the rehab they have done, that their gait or flexibility and agility has improved, and that they have been medically cleared to return to their sport, gives them confidence and allays fear, Gonzalez said.

“You learn a lot about yourself whenever you have injuries and moments like this,” he said, citing the athletes he works with and his own injuries as an NCAA Division I distance runner at the University of Pittsburgh and in marathons and trail running with Dartmouth ski teams. “You see that just because it happened once doesn’t mean it’s going to happen all the time.”

Fear or injury that comes from an unexpected fall — “a freak accident” — he said, as opposed to one that comes from a more traditional drill or exercise, means that it’s useful for an athlete to mentally prepare and visualize what’s ahead.

No matter its source, fear needs to be addressed if athletes are going to return to their sport, said Julia Kim, a clinical psychologist at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.

“If you’re afraid, you’re afraid,” she said. “If you’re not going to acknowledge it, you’re not going to address it and soothe it. But if you acknowledge it, then you can choose how you want to act.”

Kim said people need to ask themselves: “What do you want to do with the fear or anxiety? Ultimately, you have to choose how you’re going to live. You’re either going to live by avoiding your fear or are you going to live by trying to achieve your goal?”

Understand your 'why'

Part of finding that path back to your sport is also remembering why you are doing it, she said. Some play a sport by choice while others see it as a core part of their identity.

“People who do reasonably well do so because they can adapt,” Kim said. “It’s because they’re not doing it because they need it.”

If you see sport as the only way to feel good about yourself, you could benefit from developing other ways. If physical activity is your outlet for stress, find other outlets, Kim advised.

“We should all have several ways in our tool kit on how to cope with stress,” Kim said. “Because if you take one away, let’s say you’re sidelined, then what? And typically, we actually need several backups.”

Kim understands the frustration of injury. She is a longtime cyclist who has had many surgeries. She said she is frustrated when she cannot bike.

“But it’s not that it affects who I am or how I think of myself,” Kim said. “It’s that ability to adapt. You’re not going to adapt when you feel you have to have it.”

Accept and adapt

She said she has worked with many athletes who took a long time to accept that they need to adapt to other sports or activities.

One was a runner who took several years to get over multiple injuries and learn that they could not run as much and in the way they wanted to. Kim had suggested cross training, biking, swimming and other activities but was met with resistance. “Later, this person discovered biking and can now bike and run,” Kim said. “It has reduced injuries, but it took years.”

This acceptance of being on a journey back to your sport and the twists and turns it can take is something that Carrie Jackson Cheadle, a certified mental performance consultant and co-author of “Rebound: Train Your Mind to Bounce Back Stronger From Sports Injuries,” advocates through her work with athletes and as the co-host of the podcast, “The Injured Athletes Club.”

“You’re still an athlete, right?” Cheadle said she asks those who are sidelined from their sport. “This is just part of your athletic journey.” She asks them to step back and look at it from further away. “I equate it to the hero’s journey,” Cheadle said.

She advises athletes to use everything they were putting into their performance into their recovery.

Cheadle said our culture has started to remove the stigma of mental health struggles more generally, and professional athletes and other public figures are sharing their difficulties publicly. This has led to a greater understanding of the mental as well as physical parts of preventing — and healing from — injuries.

She also credits Olympian and gymnast Simone Biles for withdrawing from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics because she wasn’t in the “right head space.” It was reaffirming for athletes at all levels who are learning to do what’s best for them, Cheadle says.

There is “this very romanticized view of what it means to push through being injured, which is a narrative that I want to change,” she said. “There’s a disconnect between people not recognizing had Simone Biles pushed through, she could have sustained extreme, terrible, catastrophic injury. But we want to see the hero rise to the occasion and overcome.”

Allen said her hero’s journey back to running felt like putting on armor and discovering how she was strong in ways besides running.

“I realized the strength in asking for help and relying on a community and the process of healing and training,” she said. “And you know, to me, that almost means more than a finishing time.”

Luis Ortiz knocks out 'Prince' Charles Martin after recovering from two knockdowns in heavyweight fight,"Luis Ortiz twice hauled himself off the canvas to knock out ‘Prince’ Charles Martin in a back-and-forth heavyweight battle on Saturday in Florida.

The veteran Cuban launched an overhand left in the sixth round which badly hurt Martin and caused his demise.

The earliest exchanges had all gone the way of Martin, who had sent Ortiz tumbling to the canvas twice.

Image: Ortiz exploded powerfully to end Martin's hopes

A sneaky right hand from Martin, the former IBF champion whose loss to Anthony Joshua in 2016 means he has the second-shortest heavyweight title reign in history, shocked and floored Ortiz in the first round.

The battle of southpaw jabs was being won by Martin who, in the fourth round, timed a shot which knocked Ortiz over again.

Image: Ortiz, 42, is still a threat to the heavyweight champions

But Ortiz exploded into life in the sixth round when his powerful left hand cracked Martin flush in the face.

Martin immediately looked out on his feet.

Image: Martin had floored Ortiz twice

A series of follow-up shots from Ortiz crumpled Martin down - as he fell, his glove became twisted in the ropes and required the referee to untangle him.

Somehow Martin came back for more and valiantly continued until Ortiz's heavy shots sent him down for a second time, and the referee called a halt.

Image: Can Ortiz still become a world champion?

The 42-year-old Ortiz delivered a reminder that he remains a threat to the upper echelons of the heavyweight division.

This fight was an IBF eliminator - Martin was previously ranked at No 1 by the governing body.

Ortiz has only lost twice to Deontay Wilder in 37 career fights but has now positioned himself to potentially become the mandatory challenger for the belt that Oleksandr Usyk is set to defend against Anthony Joshua.",None
The Ashes: Adam Hollioake no longer joining England coaching staff for fourth Test due to Covid contact,"Adam Hollioake will not be joining the England set-up for the fourth Ashes Test after a close contact tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.

England had drafted in the former one-day captain to bolster their depleted coaching ranks ahead of the Test in Sydney.

However, he is now unable to join up with the travelling party, while England will not be bringing in any coaching support for the Test.

Four key members of the backroom team have been left behind in Melbourne as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak in camp. Head coach Chris Silverwood is isolating with his family, while spin coach Jeetan Patel, fast bowling mentor Jon Lewis and strength and conditioning lead Darren Veness all tested positive.

That had led to the SOS call to Hollioake, the former Surrey all-rounder who was renowned as an innovative thinker in his playing days and captained the ODI side 14 times between 1997 and 1999.

Hollioake, who made his Test debut in the 1997 Ashes alongside his late brother Ben, was seen as a perfect addition as he lives close by on the Gold Coast and is a friend and former team-mate of Silverwood's stand-in Graham Thorpe.

"2022 WWE Day 1 predictions, card, matches, start time, PPV preview, date, location","WWE wanted to waste no time getting things rolling in 2022. With that in mind, they set up their first pay-per-view event of the year for the first day of the year. WWE Day 1 goes down Saturday night from State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

Big E will defend his WWE championship against Bobby Lashley, Seth Rollins, Kevin Owens and Brock Lesnar in a fatal five-way match. Lesnar was a late addition after universal champion Roman Reigns tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced out of his defense against Lesnar.

Plus, both brands' tag team titles will be on the line on the undercard. SmackDown champions The Usos will take on two members of New Day -- Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods -- while the third member of each crew is in action later on in the night. And Raw champions RK-Bro, Randy Orton and Matthew Riddle -- battle the Street Profits.

Day 1 will set the tone for the year as WWE prepares to enter ""WrestleMania season"" with Royal Rumble on Jan. 29. The show will stream live on Peacock beginning at 8 p.m. ET following the kickoff show, which starts one hour prior.

Let's take a closer look at who our CBS Sports experts predict will come out on top at WWE Day 1.

Note: The previously scheduled Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar has been canceled after Reigns tested positive for COVID-19. Lesnar will now compete in the WWE championship match, making it a fatal five-way.

2022 WWE Day 1 predictions

Raw Tag Team Championship -- RK-Bro (c) vs. The Street Profits

While RK-Bro have been a very successful act, there's nothing WWE loves to do more than breaking up tag teams. Riddle and Randy Orton are going to break up at some point and have a big featured feud. With WrestleMania approaching, the biggest show of the year could be where we see that all come to a head. Losing the titles here would allow RK-Bro to have the first hints of a split and could easily be followed up at Royal Rumble with Orton eliminating Riddle (or vice versa) to build into a WrestleMania showdown. Pick: The Street Profits win the titles -- Brent Brookhouse

RK-Bro is getting so much screen time on Monday Night Raw that it's tough to see Street Profits dethroning them. It appears WWE is high on Riddle and his eventual split from Orton will have more heat on it if they're still champions. Pick: RK-Bro retain the titles -- Shakiel Mahjouri

Drew McIntyre vs. Madcap Moss

McIntyre beating Moss is the evening's parlay padder, practically a forgone conclusion. Rumor has it McIntyre is poised for a main event program opposite the winner of Reigns vs. Lesnar. Expect a repeat of SmackDown when McIntyre blasted Moss with the Claymore Kick. Chances are this will be Day 1's shortest affair. Pick: Drew McIntyre wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

Raw Women's Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. Liv Morgan

Morgan should win, let's make that clear. The crowd support for Morgan has been organic and intense since her failed bid to capture the Money in the Bank briefcase in July. Her fanbase is one of the most committed and feverish in pro-wrestling. Lynch is a made woman and WWE should capitalize on the chance to make Morgan a star. Sadly, and I hope I'm wrong, intuition tells me WWE will play it safe and have ""Big Time Becks"" retain. Pick: Becky Lynch retains the title -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

Edge vs. The Miz

Edge should be the favorite to win under most circumstances. However, there is a glaring reason to side with The Miz in this one: a match pitting The Miz and Maryse vs. Edge and Beth Phoenix. It's too obvious to pass up and Maryse has been so involved to this point that it seems the clear direction. The most convenient path there is to have The Miz steal the victory with an assist from his wife. It also keeps in place Edge's trend of feuds that stretch out for months with only a few actual matches. Pick: The Miz wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

SmackDown Tag Team Championship -- The Usos (c) vs. The New Day

I keep waiting for WWE to go in on Roman Reigns' world falling apart and Day 1 seems like a great time to have that happen. The Usos losing the titles early in the show could shake Reigns ahead of his match with Brock Lesnar. Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods also could use a small bump with another run as tag champions -- though it would be odd that Woods as King of the Ring would be following the same path as Zelina Vega, who won the Queen's Crown tournament and then became women's tag champ. Pick: The New Day win the titles -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)

WWE Championship -- Big E (c) vs. Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Brock Lesnar

On the rare occasions where WWE builds up a stable of challengers to a champion, it works well. It breaks the monotony of repeating cycles of one-on-one competition that always hits the same story beats. That has been the case with the WWE title picture of late. Lashley's physical dominance alongside Owens and Rollins' underhanded tactics pose many different challenges to Big E. Of course, a four-way match also leaves a lot of easy outs to allow the champion to retain while leaving challengers in place to continue moving things forward. It makes no sense to take the title off Big E yet and they've set him up in the right situation to allow him to move forward as a champion with many challengers. Pick: Big E retains the title -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)",None
"Notre Dame vs. Oklahoma State: Live stream, watch online, channel, Fiesta Bowl prediction, pick, odds, spread","No. 5 Notre Dame and No. 9 Oklahoma State meet on Saturday for a showdown in the Fiesta Bowl, as we get a New Year's Day gift featuring one of best matchups of the college football season. The Fighting Irish were the first team outside the College Football Playoff in the selection committee's final rankings, while Oklahoma State dropped to ninth after losing a close game to Baylor in the Big 12 Championship Game.

This will be the first game for new Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman, who was promoted from defensive coordinator to replace Brian Kelly after he left for LSU. Freeman's promotion has included some continuity of the coaching staff, so while Notre Dame won't have Kelly on the sidelines, the expectations are we will still see a top-five caliber program on the field in the bowl game.

Oklahoma State is back in the New Year's Six for the first time since 2015 while Notre Dame is coming off two CFP appearances in the last four years. The Cowboys have been good in bowl games under Mike Gundy, going 10-5 across a 15 straight bowl appearances heading into the Fiesta Bowl. It's a top-10 showdown with plenty of intrigue, so let's dig into the things to know for the Fiesta Bowl.

Notre Dame vs. Oklahoma State: Need to know

Notre Dame offense improved over course of the season: The Fighting Irish finished the year with seven straight wins, much of it thanks to the changes made on the offensive side of the ball. Offensive coordinator Tommy Rees will remain in that position on Freeman's staff, and the Fighting Irish are hoping those improvements show against a very good Oklahoma State defense. Notre Dame's scoring average jumped 10 points from October to November, and it finished as a top-20 scoring offense averaging 35.3 points per game.

Oklahoma State defense among best in the country: Entering the bowl season, Oklahoma State led the nation in sacks and tackles for loss while also ranking in the top five nationally in total defense (No. 3), rushing defense (No. 5) and third-down defense (No. 2). The Cowboys defense was so good that defensive coordinator Jim Knowles got the attention of Ryan Day and was hired away to take the same position at Ohio State.

Marcus Freeman's defense causes havoc for opposing quarterbacks: Before taking over in his new role as head coach, Marcus Freeman led a defense that had notable success throughout the year. Notre Dame ranked in the top 10 nationally in scoring defense (18.2 points per game) and was particularly strong when it came to rushing the passer and forcing interceptions. The Fighting Irish totaled 40 sacks on the season, good for 8th nationally, with 10 of those coming from Isaiah Foskey, who is currently tied for fourth all-time in single-season program history. When quarterbacks could get the pass off, Notre Dame would make them pay for mistakes with 15 interceptions, a number that tied for 10th nationally.

Gundy has been a great bowl coach, but I think there is a real juice around Freeman's promotion, and Notre Dame will use this game as a showcase opportunity for the program's future.

New Zealand vs Bangladesh: Conway’s century propels Black Caps on Day 1,"Devon Conway after his maiden century at home said that it is a very special feeling. (File)

After a brief interruption Devon Conway continued his prolific run-making in Test cricket with an innings of 122 which guided New Zealand to 258-5 at stumps Saturday on the first day of the first cricket test against Bangladesh.

South Africa-born Conway erupted onto the international scene in 2021 at the age of 29 with a double century in his first test innings and since has been a stand-out in all three formats. Within the space of four tests he now has scored a double century, a century and two half centuries: 501 runs at an average of 83. He also averages 75 in one-day internationals and 50 in Twenty20s.

A broken hand suffered at the T20 World Cup in November put a brief stop to his accumulation of runs and records. He quickly picked up on Saturday where he left off, placing New Zealand in a strong position at stumps after losing the toss.

Rusty when he commenced his innings after New Zealand lost captain Tom Latham in the fourth over when it was 1-1, Conway navigated the difficult first hour, then flourished, reaching his century after tea from 186 balls.

He seemed impregnable until he was finally out for 122 in the over before the second new ball was taken, to the relatively benign spin bowling of Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque. Stretching forward to an unthreatening delivery which turned down the leg side, Conway got a faint edge which carried to wicketkeeper Liton Das.

Through the day he had partnerships of 138 with Will Young (52), 50 with Ross Taylor who has out for 31 in his penultimate test and 38 with Henry Nicholls who was 32 not out at stumps. Tom Blundell was out for 11 in the last over of the day.

“I think (the pleasing thing) was just the partnerships we had throughout the day. It was nice to spend some time with Ross Taylor in the middle,” Conway said.

“It was nice to contribute, especially after not playing for such a long period of time.

“It was challenging. The wicket was quite green this morning and we knew if we got through that tough period it would always get easier to bat on.” The score at stumps didn’t fairly reflect the effort of the Bangladesh who worked tirelessly to support the decision of Mominul to bowl on winning the toss.

There was moisture in the Bay Oval pitch and Bangladesh seamers Taskin Ahmed and Shoriful Islam were ascendant in the first hour, sending back Latham and troubling Conway and Young.

Hitting good lengths with an upright seam, the bowlers found movement away from the right handers and tied down the New Zealand batsmen who eked out only one run between the first and the ninth overs. Shoriful, who dismissed Latham and later Taylor, had 1-7 from his first five overs.

Conway struggled early, surviving a review for lbw before he had scored and teasing gully with a catching chance soon after.

But as the pitch dried and switched its support from the bowlers to batsmen he settled, then began to flourish. Two fours off Shoriful in the 21st over were a sign of things to come.

He went to lunch on 36 and reached his third half century in four tests from 101 balls with a six from the spin bowling of Mehidy Hasan Miraz in an over in which he also hit two fours.

Conway had put on 138 for the second wicket with Will Young when Young was run out in the 49th over. With the bowlers struggling to find the means to a breakthrough, New Zealand wasted Young’s wickets when he set off for a single to mid-wicket and Conway sent him back. An accurate throw to the keeper saw Young run out for a hard-earned 52.",2022-01-01 12:30:44+05:30
"""The guy owes me $175,000"" - When Dana White slammed Ken Shamrock for suing the UFC","Dana White has dealt with a considerable number of lawsuits over the past two decades. One such situation was the UFC's legal battle with Ken Shamrock.

Ken Shamrock had been with the UFC for many years before the legal dispute began. In 2006, the MMA veteran lost his last fight in the promotion, a trilogy bout with Tito Ortiz.

Shamrock was released from his UFC contract in 2007. He ended up suing the UFC for breach of contract, stating that the promotion released him with one fight still left on his agreement.

Years after Ken Shamrock lost the legal battle with the promotion, the former UFC fighter publicly criticized Dana White for fighter pay in 2013. White made sure to give a fitting reply to the UFC veteran.

The UFC president slammed Shamrock for not paying $175,000 which he owed the company. During an interview with Fight Hub TV in 2013, White said:

""Let's not forget that Ken Shamrock tried to sue us about his contract. Ken Shamrock owes me $175,000, and I'm coming for it Ken. I'm coming for it you fu***g piece of sh*t. You should have stayed where you were, hidden under the fu****g porch somewhere. The guy owes me $175,000 because him and his scumbag lawyer put together some phony lawsuit that he lost, and he owes me $175,000 in attorney fees.""

Will Dana White dive into the realm of boxing anytime soon?

Dana White has been involved in boxing before and has been keen on making his mark in the sport ever since. However, the UFC president feels like the sport is a mess right now.

During a recent interview with Teddy Atlas, Dana White discussed his aspirations for venturing into boxing yet again and said:

""I'm still kicking the tires and looking around and it's very complicated, you know the sport's such a mess, it's literally a mess and to pull it off you have to actually get in there and clean it up you know. I've been working on this for years and I don't know, we'll see what happens.""

Man Charged With Impaired Driving In Accident That Killed Girl,"A Jamestown man was charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs and leaving the scene of a personal injury accident after a 15-year-old girl was struck and killed Friday.

In a news release, Jamestown police announced the arrest of Randall J. Rolison. The 58-year-old man was released and will appear in Jamestown City Court later to answer the charges.

Rolison was operating a car hauler on West Sixth Street when he hit a girl walking across the street around 12:30 p.m. near the intersection of Washington Street. The semi continued on toward West Ellicott and was eventually stopped in Lakewood.

The girl, identified as Alexis Catherine Hughan, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Additional charges are pending, and the investigation remains ongoing.

“This was a very tragic occurrence and our hearts go out to the victim’s family and friends,” Capt. Robert Samuelson of the Jamestown Police Department told The Post-Journal.

Samuelson said the department was being assisted by the Chautauqua County Sheriff’s Office, county Accident Reconstruction Team, state Department of Transportation, the Jamestown Fire Department and Alstar EMS.

“We are continuing to investigate this tragic situation,” Samuelson said.

The Jamestown Public Schools District said the victim was a student. The district said resources will be made available when students return to classes Monday.

“JPS has learned of the tragic loss of one of our students due to a fatal accident today at Sixth and Washington Streets,” the district said in a statement. “The JPD will be releasing additional information. We are deeply saddened by this terrible loss to our school community. This incident is sure to raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for our entire district, especially our students. JPS is working to ensure that school Crisis Intervention Teams will be ready Monday to help students or staff who may need assistance. Our sympathy, concern and prayers are with the family at this difficult time.”

Detectives were at the scene taking photographs and interviewing witnesses, and area surveillance video was being checked.

Meanwhile, the semi could be seen in the parking lot of the Chautauqua Mall shortly after the accident. It was not immediately made clear if charges were pending.",None

Anderson MFG. AM-15 Complete Rifle Review,"U.S.A. –-(AmmoLand.com)- I recently finished testing an Anderson Mfg. Am-15, M-LOK 5.56. I personalized it with a few after-market parts, but nothing that really enhanced the shooting abilities other than installing a Bowden Tactical trigger. So this Product Review will cover what the Anderson Mfg. AM-15, M-LOK 5.56 can basically do right out of the box.

I’ve been wanting to get a new AR for quite some time for two reasons:

I needed a new varmint rifle. I do quite a bit of varmint hunting and needed a lighter-weight rifle. It will also have a dual purpose as a self-defense gun.

Right when I picked up the Anderson MFG. AM-15, M-LOK I liked it, and knew it’d fit the bill if it shot accurately. The first item I had to install on it was a scope. For varmint hunting, a 3-9x would suffice 90% of the time, but sometimes a coyote will hold up at 200 yards when calling. I’d want a 12x or larger in those instances, so I decided to go with a Riton Optics Primal1 4-14x 44mm scope. The 4x allows me to zoom down for close shots and would also work well for any self-defense needs.

A big piece of the “obtain a good group” puzzle is what ammo you chose. It’s not fair to test a rifle with bad ammo and then say all that the rifle could obtain was a 2-inch group. I’ve had good luck with Nosler ammo, so I got some Nosler 40 gr., 55 gr., and 69 gr. ammo to test in it.

So how did it shoot? On the first outing, my best group was ¾-inches, which is better than you’d expect out a factory rifle with factory ammo. But I thought it could do better. So, I took it home and cleaned it well. With some rifles, a dirty barrel really affects their accuracy.

When I first mounted the scope, I used regular rings, but the front ring was attached to the handguard. That’s not good, as some handguards are not rock-solid, although the handguard on the Anderson rifle felt solid. So I thought it’d be prudent to use a Cantilever mount.

Anytime you’re trying to obtain a good group, you’ve got to remove all outside variables, so I grabbed a Vortex Cantilever Mount and threw it on the rile. Now to go out and see if I could improve my group with a clean barrel and the new Cantilever mount.

I went through the regular routine after mounting a new scope. The first sight in at 25 yards to get it on paper and then move out to 100 yards. I shot all three flavors of Nosler Ammunition but did the best with the Nosler 55 gr. BTV. I went out on the high desert to shoot, and as is the norm, I encountered wind. This day I was fighting gusts of up to 12 mph. I set up my Caldwell Stable Table Lite on the downwind side of my truck to block the wind the best that I could.

My target was moving a little due to the high wind gust, but luckily, some village idiot had left a cooler out there, so I set it behind my target to brace it. That stabilized it. I tell you all of the above to let you know it wasn’t necessarily primo shooting conditions. But despite all of this, I got an 11/16 group with the factory Anderson Mfg. AM-15, M-LOK rifle shooting Nosler 55 gr. BTV ammo.

I was plenty happy with this group. Now to get a varmint hunt lined up. I have to fly to South Dakota in two days and then run down to Dallas to conduct a seminar at the Dallas Safari Club Conv. & Expo, back to SD, then home, grab my stuff, and head to SHOT at the end of the week to conduct three seminars at the Safari Club International Conv. and on and on. But Bill Olson, the editor of Texas Outdoors Journal is, wants us to do a varmint right after all of these shows in either South Dakota and/or Texas. I can’t wait. Then if I get loose, I’ve got an invitation to do a hunt in Alabama. Then in the spring, the ground squirrels will be out in full force. With any luck, I may have this rifle worn out by June!!!

So, in a nutshell, I’m happy with my new ANDERSON MFG. AM-15 RIFLE. The MSRP is $681.49 (less $ online); as usual, we will close with the company specs.

Cobra Kai cast on their game-changing season 4,"From big-screen bully and victim to TV's best buddy-comedy duo — it's been a long, strange trip for Johnny and Daniel, and it's about to take yet another unexpected turn. Nearly four years after reigniting their karate rivalry in California's San Fernando Valley — a place where dojo supremacy is treated with the seriousness of the ""Mideast Peace crisis,"" jokes Macchio — the one-time adversaries teamed up at the very end of season 3. Their goal? Put sensei John Kreese (Martin Kove) and his Cobra Kai dojo out of business by defeating them at the All Valley Karate Championship. But as fans discover in season 4 (streaming now on Netflix), their road to unity is bumpier than Daniel's dirt bike ride down the hill in The Karate Kid.

"Betty White, icon of entertainment and television, dies at 99","The iconic American actress Betty White, a television mainstay and household name for more than 60 years, has died at the age of 99.

White's longtime agent and friend Jeff Witjas confirmed her death Friday. She had no diagnosed illness, and it was unclear if she died Thursday night or Friday, he said.

She would have turned 100 on Jan. 17, but her indefatigable charm, whether as a man-crazy TV hostess on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” or the loopy housemate on “The Golden Girls,” gave her personality a timeless youth that endeared her to audiences new and old alike.

Her death brought tributes from celebrities and politicians alike.

“We loved Betty White,” first lady Jill Biden said as she left a Delaware restaurant with President Joe Biden, who added: “Ninety-nine years old. As my mother would say, God love her.”

“She was great at defying expectation,” Ryan Reynolds, who starred alongside her in the comedy “The Proposal,” tweeted. “She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty.”

White launched her TV career in daytime talk shows when the medium was still in its infancy and endured well into the age of cable and streaming. Her combination of sweetness and edginess gave life to a roster of quirky characters in shows from the sitcom “Life With Elizabeth” in the early 1950s to oddball Rose Nylund in “The Golden Girls” in the ’80s to “Boston Legal,” which ran from 2004 to 2008.

But it was in 2010 that White’s stardom erupted as never before.

In a Snickers commercial that premiered during that year’s Super Bowl telecast, she impersonated an energy-sapped dude getting tackled during a backlot football game.

“Mike, you’re playing like Betty White out there,” jeered one of his chums. White, flat on the ground and covered in mud, fired back, “That’s not what your girlfriend said!”

The instantly-viral video helped spark a successful Facebook campaign to have her host “Saturday Night Live.” The much-watched episode won her a seventh Emmy.

A month later, cable’s TV Land premiered “Hot In Cleveland,” which starred Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick as three past-their-prime show-biz veterans who move to Cleveland to escape the youth obsession of Hollywood.

They move into a home being looked after by an elderly Polish widow – a character, played by White, who was meant to appear only in the pilot episode.

But White stole the show, and became a key part of the series, an immediate hit. She was voted the Entertainer of the Year by members of The Associated Press (AP).

“It’s ridiculous,” White said of the honor. “They haven’t caught on to me, and I hope they never do.”

By then, White had not only become the hippest star around, but also a role model for how to grow old joyously.

“Don’t try to be young,” she told the AP. “Just open your mind. Stay interested in stuff. There are so many things I won’t live long enough to find out about, but I’m still curious about them.”

White remained youthful in part through her skill at playing bawdy or naughty while radiating niceness. The horror spoof “Lake Placid” and “The Proposal” were marked by her characters’ surprisingly salty language. And her character Catherine Piper killed a man with a skillet on “Boston Legal.”

Her role as “Happy Homemaker” Sue Anne Nivens in “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" which was already a huge hit, was planned as a one-off appearance in 1973, but it would last until the show ended in 1977.

“While she’s icky-sweet on her cooking show, Sue is really a piranha type,” White once said. The role brought her two Emmys as supporting actress in a comedy series.

In 1985, White starred on NBC with Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty in “The Golden Girls.” Its cast of mature actors, playing single women in Miami retirement, presented a gamble in a youth-conscious industry. But it proved a solid hit and lasted until 1992.

White played Rose, a gentle, dim widow who drove her roommates crazy with off-the-wall tales of childhood in fictional St. Olaf, Minnesota.

The role won her yet another Emmy, and she reprised it in a short-lived spinoff, “The Golden Palace.”

White began her television career as $50-a-week sidekick to local Los Angeles TV personality Al Jarvis in 1949. White proved to be a natural for the new medium.

“I did that show 5 1/2 hours a day, six days a week, for 4 1/2 years,” she recalled in 1975.

A sketch she had done with Jarvis turned into a syndicated series, “Life With Elizabeth,” which won her first Emmy.

Off-screen, White tirelessly raised money for animal causes, hosting a syndicated TV show and writing three books on her animal love, which she said stemmed from her family taking care of as many as 15 dogs at a time during the Depression.

Are there any critters she doesn’t like?

“No,” White told the AP. “Anything with a leg on each corner.”

Then what about snakes?

“Ohhh, I LOVE snakes!”

She was born Betty Marion White in Oak Park, Illinois, and the family moved to Los Angeles when she was a toddler.

“I’m an only child, and I had a mother and dad who never drew a straight line: They just thought funny,” she told The Associated Press in 2015. “We’d sit around the breakfast table and then we’d start kicking it around.”

Her early ambition was to be a writer, and she wrote her grammar school graduation play, giving herself the leading role.

At Beverly Hills High School, her ambition turned to acting, and she appeared in several school plays. Her parents hoped she’d go to college, but instead she took roles in a small theater and played bit parts in radio dramas.

After two very brief marriages in the 1940s, White wed her third and final husband, actor and game show host Allen Ludden, in 1963. They remained married until his death in 1981.

When asked in 2011 how she had managed to be universally beloved during her decades-spanning career, she summed up with a dimpled smile: “I just make it my business to get along with people so I can have fun. It’s that simple.”",2022-01-01 11:38:00+03:00
Knoxville’s World’s Fair Park rings in new year,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The new year got kicked off in a new setting in Knoxville, and the crowd showed up in support.

For the first time, the City of Knoxville’s New Year’s Eve celebrations took place at World’s Fair Park. There was a possibility of rain, but the show was going to go on no matter the weather.

Fortunately for the attendees and staff working the event, it was a dry and cool night.

After 9 p.m., families started trickling into the park. KnoxVegas DJs got the party started before a local bluegrass band finished off with live music.

Event-goers could enjoy several activities such as axe throwing, dancing on the lawn, eating from local food trucks and snapping pictures around different picturesque spots like a huge inflatable champagne bottle.

While music played, people could gaze at a laser show, but the big laser light experience was just before the countdown to the new year.

Afterward, the ball dropped down from the Sunsphere, and the night ended with a huge fireworks show.

People at the event said the night was a time to spend with family and friends, enjoy the beautiful weather, reminisce on 2021 and think about what the future holds in 2022.

“I just want to have fun and end 2021 with good vibes…I’m hoping it’s going to be better than 2021. I hope we’re able to do more and get out more,” Joy Peacock, an attendee, said.

“We’re looking forward to the future because every year is a gift, so we have to get the use out of it,” Nihal Zaki, another attendee, said.

Ringing in 2022 also means celebrating the 40th anniversary of the 1982 World’s Fair and the Sunsphere.",2022-01-01 10:16:23+00:00
How much longer can China keep up its zero-Covid strategy?,"Desperate residents in China’s western Xi’an city are running out of food after they were barred from grocery shopping in a fierce lockdown. In the southern province of Guangxi, people who broke Covid laws were recently publicly shamed by being paraded through the streets in Hazmat suits with placards round their necks.

The rest of the world is learning, slowly and with some difficulty, to live with Covid-19, but in China, authorities are doubling down on their “zero-Covid” policy: trying to stamp out the disease whenever it appears, and at any cost. A single case in a border town led to 200,000 people being locked down late last month.

A key aspect of the policy is border closures. Few people are allowed in or out of China, and those who do enter the country face up three weeks of government-enforced quarantine. Some other countries locked the world out for over a year in a bid to lock out the pandemic. But in 2022, Beijing is treading an increasingly solitary path.

A combination of mass vaccination, social pressure and highly transmissible new variants has persuaded other once “zero-Covid” countries – including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore – to begin slowly opening up again to the world.

Inside China, some senior scientists and officials have also taken the political risk of calling for similar reopening, in recognition of a world where it seems Covid will become endemic. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested recently that the country could be ready when vaccination rates pass 85%, perhaps early in 2022.

Others have joined scientists abroad, warning that even Beijing’s autocratic powers and popular support for lockdowns and other control measures may not be enough to keep highly transmissible new variants out.

“China will have great difficulty with Omicron and a zero Covid policy,” Tulio Oliveira, director of South Africa’s Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, said on Twitter. He is part of the team that first alerted the World Health Organisation to the new variant.

“They may need to join the rest of the world with mitigation strategies. China should not punish its public health officials or citizens or foreigns because (of) a more transmissible variant.”

Whatever the cost, China is likely to push extremely hard to keep the virus under control for most of this year, ahead of two high-profile, high-stakes events.

Next month, Beijing will host the winter Olympics, a gathering already dogged by diplomatic boycotts over human rights abuses. In the autumn the Communist leadership will meet for their 20th Party Congress: it is expected to officially extend Xi Jinping’s hold on power by another five years.

Authorities in Beijing will have little appetite for putting either the Games or the Party Congress in jeopardy with a Covid outbreak, that would amount to an uncontrolled test of the effectiveness of domestic vaccinations and medical preparations.

The health risks of opening China up to Covid are likely to be higher than in countries that abandoned their zero Covid policies, said Sean Yuji Sylvia, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose research focuses on health economics and China’s health system.

“There are several reasons why it makes sense for China to maintain strict controls for the time being,” Sylvia said. “China has a high population density and lower herd immunity in the population due to limited exposure to the virus and less-effective vaccines.

“The health system is also relatively weak in much of the country and could easily be overwhelmed. And even if vaccines provide good protection against severe cases, patients with less-severe illness are more likely to be hospitalised in China.”

The country’s hospitals are also manned by doctors who have little clinical experience of treating Covid, while professionals elsewhere now have two years’ painfully earned understanding of its development and how best to control it.

The possible human cost of opening up also has a political dimension. Government and state media have seized on how the virus spread in other countries as evidence of poor leadership and bad decision-making.

Abandoning zero Covid could potentially trigger a crisis in hospitals and healthcare that would open the Chinese government to similar criticism. The first few weeks of the pandemic, when hospitals in Wuhan were overwhelmed and the death toll included many medics, fuelled fury and fear nationwide.

“China’s zero-Covid policy is driven primarily by social stability concerns. The regime sees Covid, Sars and other epidemics or pandemics as a health crisis that has the potential to evolve into a social crisis,” said Lynette Ong, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “With that in mind, it is not hard to understand why they are willing to defend it at all cost. But the costs are high. As the rest of world learns how to live with it, China will find itself alone, with few coping mechanisms.”

A key sign to watch for, she added is whether the approach to Covid shifts after the leadership decisions are made at the Communist Party Congress.

Strict controls have been astonishingly effective so far. Over the past four weeks, when China was battling a relatively large cluster of infections by domestic standards, authorities detected 3,400 cases and no one died.

Over the same period, more than 5.7 million people registered Covid infections in the United States, and 36,000 people died of the disease. And as other economies crumbled under the pressure of deaths and lockdowns, China continued to grow

But if its path continues to diverge from the rest of the world’s, the costs and challenges of the zero-Covid approach are almost certain to rise.

In 2020 and 2021, once China stamped out its initial outbreak, domestic spending picked up. Its factories resumed churning out goods for the world, adding Covid tests and other medical gear to their production line, for a pandemic that seemed to be passing the country by.

Now however, the economic calculus has become more complicated. Strict new lockdown and quarantine rules are affecting everything from global supply chains – as sailors wanting to return home must spend weeks in isolation – to factory output.

Trade partners are angry at the impact of suddenly imposed new border controls, with more than 6,000 Vietnamese trucks suddenly stranded at one border in late December. If other markets continue to ease Covid-related controls on movement while China remains shuttered, they may be forced to look elsewhere for trade partners..

If Beijing remains sealed off from the world, this may also diminish China’s efforts to project its influence worldwide. This has been a high profile feature of Xi Jinping’s increasingly assertive rule, including his flagship “Belt and Road” initiative, offering investment and aid around the world.

But for now, authorities have clearly prioritised the political advantages of a Covid-free China, and are willing to pay a very high price to keep that unusual status in a world where the disease is becoming endemic.

“China’s ‘dynamic clearance’ strategy has thus far proven effective at limiting the domestic spread of the disease, albeit with significant cost, effort, and trade-offs,” said Thomas Hale, associate professor in public policy at Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Governance.

“The government’s statements since the emergence of Omicron –which have touted the present strategy as a success – suggest that the point of transition (away from zero Covid) is not close, despite some discussion of this in the Chinese media.

“Moreover, when it does come, the transition may not be easy because Chinese society has gotten quite used to a low level of transmission.”",2022-01-01 17:45:12+00:00

French astrologer and doctor Nostradamus has predicted fresh disasters for 2022 including a war in France, inflation and even cannibalism.

Blind clairvoyant Baba Vanga envisaged natural disasters, a water crisis and an alien invasion by the end of next year.

And some are even speculating there could be 'World War 3', the Mirror reports.

Here is a look at some of the things we might need to be worried about over the next 12 months.

New pandemic

The biggest concern about next year is definitely Covid and whether new deadly strains will form.

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia told the Mirror ""the virus is here to stay"".

""Ultimately, we will see more waves of infection over time, but each wave will be less of a pressure on the health service,"" he explained.

Even if we do manage to get the infection rate down, some fear there could be a new virus wreaking havoc.

Baba Vanga, who has many predictions people believe continue to come true following her death in 1996, envisaged another pandemic.

This time it's predicted to be discovered in Siberia and caused by a frozen virus that will be released by climate change.

World War 3

There are serious concerns over a possible global war in the coming year - and one possible cause could be the ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan.

The incursions from nuclear-capable Chinese warplanes has ratcheted-up tensions over the tiny US-backed island.

Relations between the two nations are at their worst in 40 years, Taiwan's defence minister said at the end of last year.

Western allies of Taiwan have expressed their concern at China's open display of military might and it is widely feared any form of armed confrontation could quickly escalate into a global conflict.

Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly approved plans for ""urgent mass graves"" amid fears a war could break out after an invasion of Ukraine.

Russian outlet MK say that the burial sites were constructed as a priority after they allegedly appeared on leaked legal documents that are expected to come into force on February 1.

If that wasn’t bad enough, Nostradamus believed this would be a year involving war.

Nostradamus has some worrying 2022 predictions

Michel de Nostradame, as he was known at the time, published his infamous book Les Prophéties back in 1555 featuring 942 forecasts.

While it’s tricky to pin down exact dates with Nostradamus’ predictions, as they are based on astrological movements rather than the calendar, the prediction of war reaching Europe is one that can be narrowed down to perhaps being due in 2022.

A recurring theme throughout Nostadamus’ predictions is the invasion of France by a threat from the east.

However, the following prediction is speculated to be referring to the spring of 2022:

“Blue-head shall white-head harm in such degree, as France’s good to both shall e’er amount.”

Much like all of Nostradamus’ predictions, this one is rather vague, but it could be alluding to the breakout of World War 3.

Extreme climate event

It's definitely time to get concerned about our planet.

According to Baba Vanga, more earthquakes and tsunamis are on the cards as well as 'intense bouts of floods' in Australia and parts of Asia.

Meanwhile, many cities will be hit by water shortages with political consequences as countries are forced to find alternatives, according to her forecast.

She also predicted famine in India where temperatures will supposedly reach 50 degrees causing locusts to attack crops.

There's not much hope when turning to Nostradamus, as he predicted rising sea temperatures way back in 1555.

“Like the sun the head shall sear the shining sea:

The Black Sea’s living fish shall all but boil.

When Rhodes and Genoa

Half-starved shall be

The local folk to cut them up shall toil.”

Global temperatures continue to climb - with sea levels rise and food chain complications already starting to become apparent.

Is 2022 going to be the year in which temperatures reach breaking point?

Inflation

A worldwide pandemic, political instability and political instability have all contributed to an inflation boom in recent years.

In 2022 we can expect to see tax hikes, energy bill increases and less money in our pockets.

Another warning Nostradamus issued is about the rising prices in a failing economy and even a hint of cannibalism.

Nostradamus stated:

“No abbots, monks, no novices to learn;

Honey shall cost far more than candle-wax”

“So high the price of wheat,

That man is stirred

His fellow man to eat in his despair”

That doesn't sound too appealing.

Alien invasion

2022 could be the year where we are finally visited by extraterrestrials, but will they be friendly?

If books, films and TV shows are to be believed then we had better be prepared.

Most scenarios end up with humans having to fight off an attack from beings from another planet.

Baba Vanga believed that this will be the years aliens invade the planet by sending an asteroid to seek out life on Earth with an unfriendly outcome.

It sounds exactly like the plot of War of the Worlds, which is definitely not a good thing.

Let's hope this is one prediction she got very wrong.

What are the largest rainforests in the world?,"Rainforests are teeming with life; in fact, they are home to half of the world's plant and animal species, despite covering only 2% of Earth's total surface area. As the name suggests, rainforests are also very wet: They receive more than 70 inches (178 centimeters) of rain each year each, on average.

There are many types of rainforests, but they can be split into two general categories: tropical and temperate. Tropical rainforests are hot, lush forests located close to the equator, while the rarer temperate rainforests are found farther north or south of the equator, near coastal areas, according to the NASA Earth Observatory (opens in new tab). All of the biggest rainforests on Earth fall into the former category but we've included the largest temperate rainforest as an honorable mention at the end.

Comparing rainforest sizes is tricky, because where they start and finish is not always clear; a single forest can span several countries and may be broken up by islands or deforestation. There's no doubt about the largest and second-largest rainforests on this list, but the remaining three are based on estimates and expert opinion.

1. Amazon rainforest

(opens in new tab)

The Amazon rainforest in South America is, by far, the largest rainforest in the world. It covers about 80% of the Amazon basin, which spans at least 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers), according to the NASA Earth Observatory (opens in new tab). That's more than half the size of the U.S., which is 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square km), and three times bigger than the next-largest rainforest. The Amazon is spread across nine countries in South America, including Brazil, Peru and Colombia.

According to the World Wide Fund (WWF) (opens in new tab), the forest includes at least 10% of Earth's total biodiversity, or variety of plants, animals and other living things. This includes many species, such as sloths, harpy eagles (Harpia harpyja), Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) and jaguars (Panthera onca). Brazil has the largest chunk of Amazon rainforest, with more than 1.2 million square miles (3.17 million square km) of primary rainforest. These are mature forests that haven't been disturbed in recent times. However, Brazil is also the No. 1 country for forest loss, with a decline of more than 100,000 square miles (260,000 square km) since 2001, according to data from Global Forest Watch (opens in new tab), a nonprofit that monitors forests around the world.

""A lot of this is due to agricultural expansion,"" Elizabeth Goldman, a research manager for Global Forest Watch, told Live Science. ""Fires will be set to clear land, and oftentimes, those fires will escape into neighboring forests.""

Amazon clearing is typically for larger-scale industrial agriculture — for example, for growing animals such as cattle and crops like soy, according to Goldman. Fires contribute to climate change, which causes the forests to become hotter and drier. That makes them more flammable, creating a destructive feedback loop. Since 1978, humans have destroyed about 386,000 square miles (1 million square km) of the Amazon rainforest through deforestation, according to Mongabay (opens in new tab), a nonprofit news website for environmental science and conservation.

2. Congo Basin

(opens in new tab)

The Congo Basin rainforest in Central Africa is the second-largest rainforest, spanning more than 780,000 square miles (2 million square km), according to the WWF (opens in new tab). The rainforest encompasses six countries in West and Central Africa: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The DRC has more than 383,000 square miles (992,000 square km) of primary rainforest, more than any other country except Brazil, according to Global Forest Watch data.

Gorillas, forest elephants and thousands of other species call the Congo rainforest home. Many of these species, such as bonobos (Pan paniscus) and okapi (Okapia johnstoni), are found nowhere else on Earth. The Congo Basin is threatened by deforestation, primarily for agriculture. In contrast to the industrial agriculture deforestation in the Amazon, the Congo rainforest is typically cut down for smaller-scale agriculture — for example, by subsistence farmers who grow food to feed their families or to supply local markets, Goldman said.

""It's often cultivated for a few years until soil nutrients are depleted, and then it's left fallow for a number of years,"" Goldman said. ""And oftentimes, the forest will actually come back as secondary forest and then will get cut again. So you see this shifting cycle of loss and regrowth in those areas."" The forest is also threatened by expanding urban areas, mining and industrial logging, according to Mongabay (opens in new tab).

3. New Guinea rainforest

(opens in new tab)

The third-largest continuous rainforest in the world is on the island of New Guinea, which is split into two territories: The eastern half is part of Papua New Guinea, and the western half is part of Indonesia, according to the WWF (opens in new tab). This island covers about 303,000 square miles (786,000 square km) and is home to at least 5% of the world's plant and animal species, including tree kangaroos and crowned pigeons.

As mentioned, however, after the Amazon rainforest and the Congo Basin, it becomes harder to rank the largest rainforests. Sometimes, it's easier to measure rainforest cover by countries with clearly defined borders, Goldman said. Papua New Guinea, for example, has about 123,000 square miles (318,000 square km) of primary rainforest, according to Global Forest Watch data. The New Guinea rainforest can also be mapped to include the forests of northern Australia as they were once connected; New Guinea and Australia became separated by ocean about 11,700 years ago, according to the Australian government's Geoscience Australia (opens in new tab) website.

Commercial logging and agriculture are rapidly deforesting New Guinea. The process usually starts with selective logging of commercially valuable timber, with the area then more likely to be converted to industrial plantations to grow crops such as palm oil, according to Mongabay (opens in new tab).

4. Sundaland rainforest

The Sundaland rainforest is the next-biggest rainforest, at about 197,000 square miles (510,000 square km), according to Mongabay (opens in new tab). The rainforest includes the Malay Peninsula on mainland Southeast Asia and the nearby islands of Sumatra, Java and Borneo. It spans several countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand and Singapore. (Here's where things get confusing: Indonesia is actually home to two separate rainforest blocks: Sundaland and the aforementioned New Guinea rainforest. Indonesia has the third-largest primary rainforest cover of any country, with more than 324,000 square miles (840,000 square km), according to Global Forest Watch data.)

The Sundaland rainforest is home to many species including orangutans, Bornean rainbow toads (Ansonia latidisca) and corpse flowers (Rafflesia arnoldi), the world's largest flower. Indonesia's primary rainforest has declined by more than 37,000 square miles (97,000 square km) since 2001, according to Global Forest Watch data. Nonetheless, Goldman considers the country one of the brighter spots when it comes to deforestation.

""Historically, there has been a lot of commercial oil palm plantation establishment or timber extraction,"" Goldman said. ""But as of the past four years, we've seen decreasing primary forest loss in Indonesia and Malaysia."" The Indonesian government has been very active in trying to reduce deforestation, especially since the country was badly affected by fires in 2015, she added.

5. Mekong River basin

The Mekong River basin surrounds the Mekong River, which is the longest river in Southeast Asia, at almost 3,000 miles (4,900 km) long, according to the Mekong River Commission (opens in new tab). Myanmar is the most forested country in the Mekong River basin region, with about 51,700 square miles (134,000 square km) of primary rainforest within its borders, according to Global Forest Watch data.

The Mekong River contains more than 1,000 freshwater fish species, including endangered species not found anywhere else, such as the Mekong giant catfish (Pangasianodon gigas), according to the WWF (opens in new tab). The rainforests around the river contain a variety of other species, from psychedelic rock geckos (Cnemaspis psychedelica) to tigers (Panthera tigris). Large-scale agriculture is the primary driver of deforestation in the Greater Mekong region, especially the production of sugar rice, rubber and biofuels, according to a 2015 report (opens in new tab) by the WWF.

Honorable mention: Tongass National Forest

The largest temperate rainforest in the world is Tongass National Forest in Alaska. It is smaller than any of the tropical rainforests on this list at about 26,250 square miles (68,000 square km), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (opens in new tab) (USDA). Temperate rainforests cover less land than tropical rainforests, and are found in cooler climates, usually next to oceans.

Stretching along the coastline of Southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest is home to wildlife such as salmon, brown bears (Ursus arctos), black bears (Ursus americanus) and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Tongass National Forest has declined over the last century due to logging and continues to be threatened by it today, according to the National Audubon Society (opens in new tab), a nonprofit bird and habitat conservation organization. The forest is also vulnerable to climate change and threatened by drought, according to the USDA (opens in new tab).",2022-01-01 13:00:45+00:00
World’s most notorious playboy Travers Benyon vows to return to non-stop party lifestyle after being stopped by Covid,"INFAMOUS millionaire playboy Travers Benyon has vowed to return to his insane non-stop partying lifestyle after being stopped by Covid.

Travers - aka The Candyman - has said strict lockdowns have forced him to take things slow, but he said it is merely the ""calm before the storm"".

The 49-year-old tobacco tycoon explained to The Sun Online that the Covid rules in Australia - some of the world's strictest - have halted his hedonistic antics.

But he has instead used his days stuck in lockdown to focus on personal projects and family time.

Travers told The Sun Online: “Covid restrictions have been difficult to navigate here in Australia so I have used my time to do many renovation projects to the Candy Shop Mansion.”

The ostentatious and palatial pad in Australia’s sun-kissed Gold Coast home down under has played host to countless extravagant parties.

But these days the 15-bedroom, 19-bathroom family home he shares with his wife and four children is now more sedate due to the virus.

Before the pandemic, the Instagram star’s account was full of images and videos chronicling his polyamorous lifestyle.

Travers used to be snapped sharing his bed each with ""three or four"" different scantily clad women and once said he was encouraged by this partner to do so.

Yet now his Instagram appears to show him enjoying domestic bliss.

Despite his wild parties, he said ""family always comes first, business second and then the parties”.

However, Travis said the good times will roll once again at the Candy Shop Mansion.

He said: “Consider it the calm before the storm.”

Earlier this year, Travis' 19-year model daughter, Lucciana Benyon, lifted the lid on what it was like living with her dad’s multiple girlfriends in their raunchy mansion.

Lucciana said that while some teens worry about telling their parents what they get up to, her stories are relatively tame compared to those of her tobacco magnate father.

Consider it the calm before the storm Travers Benyon

Before Covid rules pooped his parties, bashes could cost more than £240,000 each — and feature hundreds of bikini-clad women, spectacular entertainment and endless supplies of booze and food.

Her dad is known for his polyamorous lifestyle, but while Lucciana insists that she is not into polygamy, she said it was “a lot of fun” growing up surrounded by so many women.

Despite her dad’s wild lifestyle, Lucciana said he was strict with her, and she was once grounded for three months for sneaking out without permission.

Travers has been dubbed Australia's answer to Playboy's Hugh Hefner and professional poker player Dan Bilzerian, and his parties are notorious.

They were held at his Gold Coast mansion, and 1,200 VIP guests were selected from more than 12,000 applicants to enjoy alcohol, performances and live DJ sets.

Speaking about his party lifestyle back in 2018, Travers said his wife Taesha encourages his party lifestyle.

He said: ""I would also like to put some blame on my wife, because she used to talk quite openly about a girl that she would like.

""Taesha and I first met at a party in 2009.

“We didn't talk that much that day because I was busy running the party.

“We (later) bumped into each other at a nightclub and it went from there. She started to come around and I told her the Candyman concept and my vision.""

""She is the one that I disclose everything to, she's the one I have the most trust for and she's the mother of our children and the one that's going to be there long term.""

At the time, he added he shares his bed with ""three or four"" different women in an average week.

The Instagram star said: ""It's not so much between Nisha and Taesha but between the girls that came in groups fighting for my affection, if they're trying to pull me away.

""I'm a good manager and I have to be not just at work but at home, with such a dynamic family and relationships.

""I've been with Taesha, nine, 10 years. They said it wouldn't last because she's so young but she ticked a lot of boxes and she believed in what I was doing. Nisha came on the scene three years ago and people said it's impossible.

“It's a massive family when you start to consider all the different relationships and we all do get on as a family.""",2022-01-01 12:34:30+00:00

(Xinhua/Zhao Zishuo)

BANGKOK – The world's largest free trade pact forged by 15 Asia-Pacific countries entered into force Saturday to provide a tailwind for the region's post-pandemic recovery and a catalyst for global economic progress, bringing a ray of hope.

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement groups 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries, as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, covering nearly a third of the world's population and gross domestic product.

Given its size and terms, the RCEP is widely expected to bolster regional trade and investment flows and boost economic integration and prosperity in the region and beyond.

""The golden age of durian trade is coming,"" said Edwyn Chiang, secretary general of the Malaysia International Durian Industry Development Association, expecting the RCEP to spur exports of the thorny ""king of fruits"" by 50 percent by the year 2030.

The RCEP will open a broader market and development space for Malaysia's agriculture sector, strengthen the country's agricultural product trade as well as the sector's investment and cooperation with other member countries, Chiang said.

""This (RCEP) will not only present new opportunities for Malaysian businesses, but also for regional business communities tapping into RCEP to access Malaysian and Asean markets more broadly,"" Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said.

The free trade bloc is expected to eventually eliminate tariffs on more than 90 percent of goods, expand market access for investment, harmonize rules and regulations, streamline customs procedures, and set common rules concerning the development of e-commerce as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, according to business insiders.

Asean Secretary-General Dato Lim Jock Hoi said the pact will ""open up opportunities that could catalyze the expansion of regional trade and investment.""

""Under the RCEP agreement, the region will become a single production base as well as a market for its products,"" he said.

‘Center of gravity for global trade’

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said the RCEP will create ""a center of gravity for global trade,"" expecting the agreement's tariff concessions to boost exports within the region by USD42 billion.

Businesses with global supply chains might face tariffs even within a free trade area (FTA) if their products contain components that are made elsewhere.

Under the RCEP's rules of origin, parts from any member country would be treated equally, which might give companies in RCEP countries an incentive to look within the region for suppliers, analysts said.

The RCEP's tariff concessions, unified rules of origin and simplification of customs procedures ""will enable our company to purchase raw materials and equipment as well as distribution of products more efficiently and at a lower cost,"" said Qiu Jinliang, managing director of Himile (Thailand) Co., a tire mold supplier.

Li Yanqiang, chairman of Beibu Gulf Port Group in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, expected the RCEP to promote economic and trade cooperation within the region and increase the port's container throughput.

Of the 44 shipping routes linking the port with overseas ports, 28 are connected to RCEP countries, Li said.

By 2030, the RCEP will increase the member economies' incomes by 0.6 percent, adding USD245 billion annually and 2.8 million jobs to the regional economy, according to a study by the Asian Development Bank.

‘A shot in the arm’ for global economy

The RCEP came into force initially in 10 countries that have submitted instruments of ratification with the Asean Secretariat.

As global economic recovery still moves in fits and starts, the RCEP's entry into force would definitely be ""a shot in the arm"" for the world economic and trade development, said Ge Hongliang, deputy director with the College of ASEAN Studies at the Guangxi University for Nationalities.

""It will help sustain the global economic recovery and mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic,"" Ge said.

In the latest World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimmed its 2021 global growth forecast to 5.9 percent from a 6-percent forecast made in July. It kept a 2022 global growth forecast unchanged at 4.9 percent.

""This modest headline revision, however, masks large downgrades for some countries,"" the IMF said in the report, adding that the worsening pandemic dynamics have darkened the outlook for low-income developing countries while advanced economies are struggling with supply disruptions.

The increase of regional trade through the RCEP will restore some economic activities shut down or slowed down by the pandemic, said William Jones, Washington bureau chief of the US publication Executive Intelligence Review.

""The increase in the 'flow' of goods and services enabled by the digital economy also leads to increased economic growth,"" Jones said, expecting an e-commerce boost through the RCEP to lift growth.

The RCEP facilitates deeper integration of supply chains, while the flexibility and mobility in the flow of goods and services will create an Asia-Pacific super supply chain that can address supply disruptions caused by the pandemic, said Lawrence Loh, a professor at the National University of Singapore's Business School.

Raven Leilani: ‘I was flying by the seat of my pants’,"Raven Leilani is the author of Luster, a kinetic, award-winning debut novel whose fans include Barack Obama. Now published in paperback, it tells the story of Edie, a young black woman trying to find her way as a painter in New York City. After getting fired from an entry-level publishing job and ground down by the gig economy, Edie moves in with her middle-aged white lover, his white wife, and their (adopted) black daughter in the suburbs. Cue a plethora of razor-sharp, caustically funny insights into the politics of race, gender and desire. Leilani, 31, spoke from her home in Brooklyn.

What inspired Luster?

I wrote it when I was in NYU’s MFA [creative writing] programme, which I’d come to with an entirely different novel. When my teachers asked me whether I had any real intention behind my project and I couldn’t articulate an answer, I started Luster. I wanted to write something that felt honest and urgent. Because I was trying to scrabble together pages, I wrote in a panic and edited myself emotionally less, so the work came from a more vulnerable place. And some of the most vulnerable subjects for me, I guess, are art and intimacy and failure.

How much did you plot in advance?

I was flying by the seat of my pants. I knew I was going to write about painting and I absolutely knew that I was going to write about Edie’s experience in the middle of this open relationship, but the book kept changing as I was writing. It still feels crazy to admit this, but Edie was supposed to die.

My brain doesn't turn completely on until the sun goes down

I’m so glad she didn’t! She is such a unique force. Were there any other literary characters who helped you glimpse who she might be?

She came from an intensely personal place, but there existed in the ether these threads that introduce women who were allowed to fail and be fallible, to be sexual and make mistakes and even be complicit in their own subjugation. Toni Morrison’s Sula is a crucial text in rendering the interior lives of complicated, contradictory black women. Brit Bennett’s The Mothers is a more contemporary example of a woman’s ambivalence and fallibility. Candice Carty-Williams’s Queenie made me feel able to write candidly about sex and yearning.

There’s a moment when Edie fantasises about being hit and then lets her older white boyfriend do just that. How have readers responded to this?

It comes up a lot. It’s one of those things where I think, in 20 years, will I look back and have qualms? But currently I’m happy I was able to represent her pleasure on the page without judgment. It’s a deeply tricky thing to write about a black woman who is inviting this kind of violence. I wanted her to be a character who has the freedom to find pleasure where she finds it, but it is, too, still quite intertwined with the fact that because she is a black woman, she experiences these loud and soft violences in her public life, and choosing it in her private life is a way to exert that control that she doesn’t have elsewhere.

Sex scenes can be tough to write. What guided you?

I wrote them in a way that was sensitive to the private logistics and the trial and error of longing, and of developing – especially as a young woman – an informed idea of what your pleasure looks like, and how to ask for it.

Authentic desire can feel so fraught as a woman, right?

Yes, extremely. You have to undo a lifetime’s worth of conditioning. The moment I turned 30, my algorithm began showing me Botox. No shaming – what makes you feel beautiful makes you feel beautiful – but that programming is so deeply insidious that the work of saying simply “this is what feels good” is still extremely radical.

I got nothing but rejections. But I love writing so much, I was happy to be living in those worlds that I’d made

Luster captures so acutely the grind of keeping body and soul together while trying to make it in a city like New York.

That was one of a handful of missions I had going into the book – not to represent the starving artist, the exhaustion, as a romance. It was important to me to talk about the roaches and the mice as opposed to the mythic end of the journey where you have the apartment in the sky.

You worked for five years in between finishing college and starting your MFA. What kept you going creatively?

I was mostly concerned with how to pay my student debt and how to pay my rent. I would come home after work and write. I remember the first time I started submitting poems – I got nothing but rejections. But I love writing so much, I was happy to be living in those worlds that I’d made.

Has it always been that way for you?

Yes. I was a solitary kid and when I started writing around eight or nine, that was how I’d create my own fun. It still is.

Tell me about your own connection to painting.

My brother was a painter, and I inherited my love of that medium from him, but I felt I couldn’t be good enough as fast as I wanted, and so for a while I didn’t paint at all. During the pandemic, I started again, and I remembered why it was my first love.

Are your paintings abstract or figurative?

Always figurative. I am obsessed with the body – with the parts that are pleasure and the parts that are pain and dysfunction. If you can draw a hand, it’s a superpower.

Do you have a writing routine?

My brain doesn’t turn completely on until the sun goes down, so I write at night, in bed – where I am right now – and to music.

What was on your playlist for Luster?

A ton of disco. I had my Diana Ross, my Sister Sledge, but I also listened to Metallica. I crave that abrasive wall of sound – it really centres me both in life and on the page.

You’ve worked in publishing. Would you say the industry’s finally getting to grips with its representation problem?

I’d say that we’re making strides but there’s still a lot of work to be done. I am optimistic, partly because we have so many writers from marginalised groups working who are incredibly brilliant, incredibly fresh and incredibly hungry.

If I asked you to name a black female writer who deserves more recognition, who would you choose?

Asali Solomon, whose book The Days of Afrekete came out recently. I don’t know that she’s underrated but I feel like she is an absolute genius. I love what she does formally and what she manages to emotionally pack into very few pages.

What books are currently on your bedside table?

Sometimes I Trip on How Happy We Could Be by Nichole Perkins, The School for Good Mothers by Jessamine Chan, How Music Works by David Byrne, and Sheila Heti’s new novel, Pure Colour. If ever I’m stuck, I’ll pick up a book that will give me fuel. Heti’s How Should a Person Be? is a text I refer to a lot.

What did you read as a child?

The kind of books that you read when your parents just see you reading and they don’t realise what you’re reading. So Anne Rice, Laurell K Hamilton, the really sexy gothic vampire fiction – I loved those.

What writers working today do you most admire?

I would say both Zadie Smith and Katie Kitamura. I’ve been lucky that they are heroes and I’ve also got to learn from them as teachers.",2022-01-01 18:00:03+00:00

Disconnect on the impeccably green island of Eigg

In both ethics and aesthetics, Eigg is remarkable. In sustainability terms, it’s unique: the first island, indeed region of the UK, to be self-sufficient in renewable energy. Eigg disconnected from the mainland back in 2008. By balancing solar, water and wind power, the community-owned Eigg Electric provides enough power all year round to supply the 100 or so permanent residents and the 10,000 visitors who come every summer.

The wind turbines were positioned on the slopes of Eigg’s landmark mountain, An Sgurr, not only to maximise wind exposure and minimise turbulence, but to fit into the spectacular setting. Even the solar panels on a flowery south-facing hillside look good.

Ownership of Eigg was transferred to a Heritage Trust in partnership with the Scottish Wildlife Trust in 1997, with contributions from thousands of members of the public. With empathy and commitment, the community has organised its island so that we can enjoy it too. No visiting cars or campervans are allowed, but it’s small enough for a day trip (from Arisaig on the mainland, a one-hour ferry ride). The redeveloped An Laimhrig community hub with cafe – designed by Hebridean architect Will Tunnell, will open in time for the 25th anniversary of the community takeover this summer – and the annual celebratory party takes place on 12 June.

Nowhere on Eigg is more than a two-mile hike and Charlie’s taxi is usually by the pier. Next door to the cafe, the shop has a surprisingly eclectic range of goodies and essentials, and bikes to hire.

Despite Eigg’s size (five miles by three), it has several places to stay, including a guesthouse and a great hostel, and campers are welcomed. A new (sustainable) shower block and cool camping pods (from £45 a night for four) by the pier opened last year, and the Isle of Eigg Brewery, a cooperative operating along impeccably green lines, will open in 2022.

The climb up An Sgurr is rewarded with one of the best views in the Highlands. Walks around Laig Bay, with views across to Muck and mighty Rum, could be taken every day, and the ethereal interplay of sand, sea and sky would still mesmerise. Last summer I visited a lot of Scottish islands for a new photo guide to be published in the spring, but none has its act as consummately planned and holistically together as Eigg. isleofeigg.org

Thessaloniki’s cosmopolitan and tolerant energy

Photograph: Teodor Lazarev/Alamy

I spent the best part of last summer lying on idyllic and isolated Greek island beaches thinking about a very different place and time: the rich and complicated urban history of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second city.

British historian Mark Mazower’s thought-provoking book, Salonica: City of Ghosts, transported me from the Byzantine to the Ottoman era, the city’s integration into the new Greek state in the early 20th century and the fallout from the second world war. As much of the region continues to tread a dangerous path of deepening nationalist hostility, Thessaloniki’s history of diversity and coexistence is a sobering reminder that things do not have to be this way: Christians, Muslims and Jews lived side by side in peace for hundreds of years.

Salonica, as it is is also called, was the only city in Europe with a majority Jewish population – the “Jerusalem of the Balkans”, though few survived the Nazi occupation and Holocaust. However, Thessaloniki’s cosmopolitan and tolerant energy survives today, with a vibrant culinary and cultural scene. It was recently named Greece’s first Unesco city of gastronomy

I will be going for the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival in March on one of the high-speed trains from Athens which launch this month. From the UK, get a train to Bari or Ancona in Italy, then ferry to Patras and continue on Greek railways (OSE) via Athens to Thessaloniki (with a short substitute bus on the first, Patras-Kiato, section).

Cycle Grenoble’s riverside parks

The city of Grenoble, in south-east France, has been named Green Capital of Europe for 2022, and while it’s well known to skiers, it makes a great destination year-round. Head there in spring, when the train via Paris whizzes through Burgundy’s blooming vineyards and on into the mountains. Grenoble sits at the point where three valleys meet, and is surrounded by the Belledonne, Vercors and Chartreuse mountains. Getting around is easy: the city’s cycle-share scheme, Métrovélo, has 7,000 bikes, and there are 200 miles of cycling routes in and around the city. Visitors can ride between parks and out along paths that follow the rivers Drac and Isère.

For the best views, take the cable car from the city centre up 500 metres to the 19th-century Fort Bastille. Hikers are spoiled for choice with trails that zigzag around the mountains. The food scene has long embraced sustainability, and several restaurants use only local produce. Book a table at Jeanette, where chefs Manon Bocquentin and Thaïs Giannetti use suppliers from within 20 miles of the restaurant and forage for mountain herbs for their delicate and inventive dishes.

To rest weary limbs after hiking and biking, check into the bright and modern Okko Grenoble Jardin Hoche Hotel (doubles from €98 room-only) in the ecodistrict of Zac de Bonne. The first of its kind in Europe, it’s a former military brownfield site that was transformed into a sustainable community.

Molise is waiting to be discovered

Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/Alamy

Molise, a sparsely populated region of southern Italy, is so off the radar that many Italians joke that “Molise non esiste” (Molise doesn’t exist). But after visiting for the first time in 2019, I realised the mockery is unfair. Molise contains the very best of Italy, from the scenery to the food. But best of all, it feels like uncharted territory.

Being someone who enjoys travelling by train, I am now looking forward to returning in 2022 on board the Molise Express, a vintage train that will show visitors the best of the region’s mountains, coastlines and ancient villages.

“Molise is among the least-known regions in Italy,” said Fabrizio Minichetti, president of Le Rotaie-Molise, the association that helped launch the initiative. “But we have mountains, the sea, wonderful scenery and many beauty spots that deserve to be discovered.”

The service will be rolled out this year and take passengers through the Biferno valley, from the coastal town of Termoli to the regional capital of Campobasso, stopping off at the villages of Casacalenda and Larino before returning to Termoli. The day trip, costing €24, will give passengers ample time to explore the historic towns, including a trip to the Kalenarte open-air contemporary art museum in Casacalenda. The train carriages, with wooden interiors, date back to the 1920s.

The initiative is one of several vintage train routes planned in Italy as the country seeks to promote train tourism. In 2023, the Dolce Vita train will be launched: it’s a luxurious sleeper that will show passengers the best of the Italian landscape, from north to south, with stops in more than 100 cities. The service plans to introduce visitors to lesser-known spots, such as the Sila mountains in Calabria.

A monastery and brewery under one roof in Prague

It’s one of the greenest cities in Europe when it comes to parks and open spaces, but Prague has been sluggish on the uptake of sustainability – aside from the newly installed pink city bikes and a sprinkling of zero-waste grocery stores. That’s what makes the Břevnov Monastery such a great spot. Founded in 993, this still-active Benedictine friary is a fascinating U-shaped complex, enveloped in a tangle of trees, lakes and winding little paths.

The embedded Adalbert Hotel (doubles from €75 B&B) is an award-winning guesthouse, and its recent eco-revamp has seen it embrace a number of sustainable, planet-saving practices, such as waste reduction, energy saving and using environmentally friendly products. As well as the hotel and monastery (tours available), the complex also rather brilliantly houses a brewery – the oldest in the Czech Republic, no less. You can sample their lagers, IPAs and wheat beers from the bottle shop-cum-beer hovel, or even better, head to their rustic, fire-heated tavern opposite and combine it with a bowl of delicious mushroom soup.

Ancient theatres get back in the act

Photograph: LordHenriVoton/Getty Images

The Epirus coast is one of the prettiest in Greece, yet one of the least visited, despite having the most accessible stretch of beaches for those who prefer to avoid flying, as it starts south of Igoumenitsa, terminus of the ferries from Italy.

I went on holiday to Parga when I was 12 and have vowed to return ever since. Not a resort on everyone’s radar, Parga is built over a double-curve bay. Memories of its transparent waters, fringed as they were by jungle-thick vegetation, merge in my mind with those of Brazil’s, a later love of mine.

Syvota, further north, presents an incongruous sight to Greece aficionados: a mountain village lording it over a magnificent coast, whose low treeline resembles a Norwegian fjord. I have long yearned to explore its archipelago of tiny offshore islands and their pristine sandy beaches.

It’s ancient history, though, that grabs me this year, associated with five ancient theatres restored and promoted as part of a new archaeological route. I’m particularly curious about Gitana, with its carved seat names – unusually one reserved for a woman, called Filista – and romantic Dodona, built by Pyrrhus, him of the “pyrrhic” victory which inspired Lord Byron to write a poem.

I won’t miss the theatre at ancient Nikopolis, founded by Octavian after his victory against Anthony and Cleopatra. Its successor, Preveza, is a delightful, laid-back town worth exploring that serves both as a cultural springboard and as a holiday choice in its own right, with a good share of pleasingly uncrowded beaches.

The beaches and cosmopolitan backstreets of Piran

I had spotted it on the map a few years ago: Slovenia has a coastline. Who knew? The region around the Italian port of Trieste is full of such geographic curiosities; the borders having ebbed and flowed with the tides of empire ever since the Romans lost the plot at the close of the sixth century. At the end of the second world war, Tito’s Yugoslavia occupied the wider area, but later agreements pushed back, snipping all but 29 miles of coast from what was, until 1991, the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, sandwiched between Croatia and Italy.

Last year I managed to snatch a brief look at one of the towns, Piran, a gorgeous labyrinth of old Venetian architecture around a lovely harbour. It’s the sort of town where you get lost, discover some fantastic back streets, then emerge totally disoriented close to where you started.

Despite swapping countries and empires with baffling frequency, it retains a laid-back cosmopolitan ambience. In high summer, I am told, it gets over-populated with visitors, so I’ll avoid those months: I just want to wander in those shady slot canyons of ancient houses, emerging occasionally by the sea to eat a seafood platter or some of the excellent prśut (cured ham) with a glass of a Slovenian wine.

The hills behind the town are known for their teran reds and malvazija whites, but don’t miss the other local speciality, dry white rebula. The nearby town of Izola looks interesting and Portorož is said to have a good beach. For cycling tours check out Visit Good Place.

Cycle all the way to the Black Sea

An unusual, but highly sustainable way to explore some of Germany’s lesser-touted regions is to hop on your bike – or rent one locally – and follow part of the Iron Curtain Trail. Officially called the EuroVelo 13, the trail stretches over 6,000 miles along the former cold war divide between east and west, from the Black Sea up to the Barents Sea.

The Germany section combines two separate routes: the Baltic Sea Cycle Route, where you can experience stunning coastal landscapes and beach-peppered holiday islands like Usedom and Rügen; and the German-German Border Trail, whose former depopulated zones have been transformed into a major green belt.

As you make your way down past the border areas with Poland and the Czech Republic, you’ll find plenty of nature areas, including the Lauenburg Lakes and Harz mountains, plus dense forests and sights like Wartburg Castle. If it’s not far enough, continue all the way down to the Black Sea. If it’s too far, try the Iron Curtain Gravel Trail.

Temptation overload on Galicia’s dramatic west coast

Cíes Islands. Photograph: Karen Goncalves/Getty Images

Beyond Santiago de Compostela, Spain’s beautifully green north-west corner remains one of the country’s less-visited pockets. On Galicia’s west coast, where the mist-shrouded Costa da Morte gives way to the deep inlets of the Rías Baixas, fabulous fresh seafood, silky Atlantic surf beaches, clifftop hiking trails, up-and-coming albariño wineries and pristine offshore islands are just some of the temptations.

Opened in 2020, the sustainability-driven Parador Costa da Morte (doubles from €150), near Muxía, ups the appeal, with design inspired by Galician culture and landscapes; it’s part of a years-in-the-making regeneration project after a 2002 oil spill. Or stay at an inspiring rural hotel such as Casa Fontequeiroso (doubles from €70 B&B)– a stone-built 100-year-old home above off-the-beaten-track Nemiña beach, where Mari Carmen Leis Calo serves home-cooked meals. A quick ferry ride from Vigo (Easter week and May to September) lie the stunning Cíes Islands, whose plunging cliffs and pearly beaches are the stars of the Illas Atlánticas (Atlantic Islands) national park.

A pilgrimage to Bardsey Island

Bardsey Island, or Ynys Enlli, a lump of Precambrian rock in the Irish Sea off the Llŷn peninsula in north-west Wales, has been a place of tranquil worship since the sixth century, and a place of dedicated pilgrimage since the middle ages. I feel as if I have been trying to get there for almost as long. Over the years, I have been foiled by storms twice (the two-mile ferry crossing from the mainland through strong tidal races is frequently disrupted), misadventure and even the birth of one of my children.

Going on a “pilgrimage” has seen renewed interest recently, with people seeking meaning and adding purpose to a trip – and in the spirit of the steadfast pilgrimages our forebears made to Bardsey, known as the “Island of 20,000 saints”, I am going to cycle there in 2022 – 150 miles from my home in the Black Mountains, following winding green river valleys and crossing the hauntingly empty moors of mid-Wales. Training for this will help fulfil another key goal for this year: to finally slough off the lockdown laziness and get seriously fit once again.

Algae, almonds and an eco retreat near Olhão

An “old sea dog” known to his family as the Champ, Joaquim Modesto de Brito inspired his grandchildren to build Casa Modesta (doubles from €120 B&B) converted into an ecoretreat from the old family home on the edge of the eastern Algarve’s Ria Formosa, a natural park. The renovation by grandson Carlos Fernandes used locally sourced and sustainable materials, and an organic garden was sown so that the harvest could be enjoyed by guests.

A partner of FEE (Foundation for Environmental Education), it has nine rooms, decorated by Fernandes’s sister, Vânia, making features of the original vaulted ceilings and terracotta floors. Local olives, almonds and algae are used in the spa treatments, and bikes are provided for guests to explore the cycle paths along the estuary, as well as the nearby fishing town of Olhão. The family says: “Our door is always open to welcome those who arrive with the same joy with which we would run to our grandparents’ arms when we were little.”

Cutting-edge culture in Antwerp

Photograph: Karin Borghouts/KMSKA

Whether art to you means a directional Dries Van Noten outfit or a dark and dramatic Rubens painting, Antwerp will appeal. The city combines an artistic pedigree dating back to the Flemish masters in the city’s 16th-century golden age with a thriving fashion scene, forward-thinking back-street galleries and edgy warehouse clubs.

This year is an especially important year for the city, with the reopening of the Fine Arts Museum (KMSKA) in September after a 10-year renovation. The revamp of its beautiful historic building includes a new wing over four painstakingly restored courtyards. Two halls will be dedicated to Antwerp’s most famous painters: Rubens and Van Dyck.

KMSKA is conveniently located in the trendy Zuid neighbourhood, handy for Antwerp’s more recent cultural contributions. Here you’ll find MoMu, a world-famous fashion museum, alongside Ann Demeulemeester’s airy flagship store and Dries van Noten’s Het Modepaleis, which mixes cutting-edge design with vintage furniture. For up and coming designers, try Nationalestraat and Kloosterstraat.

For an insight into the future of Antwerpian culture, visit Het Eilandje in the northern docklands. There are forward-thinking restaurants in the Felix Pakhuis warehouse and contemporary galleries along the Artland trail, as well as MAS, a maritime museum with spectacular city views. Borgerhout, near the central station, is popular among a younger, artier crowd – try Pekfabriek, a club in a former pitch factory that hosts Belgium’s best underground DJs.

Sustainable luxury in one of Europe’s top surfing towns

The town of Ericeira, north of Lisbon, may be famous as a world-class surfing spot, but until now it had no five-star hotel. There is an abundance of hostels and guesthouses, but Immerso (doubles from €175 B&B), built into a green valley just outside the town, will be the first high-level destination hotel aiming to combine a concern for the environment – on local and planetary levels – and luxury.

The owners say sustainability is at the heart of the project and that the design and colour palette will reflect the landscape and the sea. Due to open in early summer, Immerso will have 37 rooms and a restaurant – Emme – under the consulting guidance of Michelin-starred chef Alexandre Silva of Lisbon’s Loco restaurant. There will be a vegetable garden, in-house beer production (one Pilsner, one ale) and plans are afoot to host surfboard workshops.

Clock up your steps on the Lake District’s Ullswater Way

Photograph: Clearview/Alamy

In late 2020 a new bridge opened at the northern end of Ullswater, five years after Storm Desmond destroyed the old one, and first across it was a flock of sheep. Leave the car behind and go off-season for spring flowers, autumn colours or crisp winter hikes. Penrith station is half an hour away by bus: the 508 rolls from there, past the green fells that rise out of Ullswater’s misty, island-dotted water. Ullswater Steamers from Pooley Bridge run to remote Howtown Pier on the eastern shore of the lake or to the 150-metre-high Aira Force waterfall on the west.

The Ullswater Way is a weekend-ready, 20-mile circuit of the lake. It climbs to the iron age circle of Maiden Castle, with views that stretch east to the Pennines, and heads down again through rugged, ferny woods. Fellwalking author Alfred Wainwright called Ullswater “loveliest of lakes, curving gracefully into the far distance”, and opined that the seven mossy waterside miles from Howtown to Glenridding formed the “most beautiful and rewarding walk in Lakeland”.

The Ullswater Way opened in 2016; its daffodil waymarkings flag up that this is the lake where Wordsworth wandered past his verse-inspiring flowers. A new five-mile loop from Pooley Bridge leads to the Dalemain Estate, for tea by a log fire in the medieval hall; another detour, added in 2019, takes in Lowther Castle.

Stay in a hobbit hole or a cabin with a stargazing roof at green-award-winning glamping complex the Quiet Site (from £85 a night for two adults and four children). It’s right on the Ullswater Way, and there’s a zero-waste shop and off-grid cafe. New pet- and family-friendly, carbon-positive Gingerbread Houses with wooden walls, heat pumps and beech hedges, opened in 2021.

700km of waterways for the taking in a Unesco biosphere

Kopački Rit nature park Photograph: Hemis/Alamy

They’re calling it the “Amazon of Europe” – which might be overselling it a tad – a vast, newly declared Unesco biosphere reserve that follows the routes of the Mura, Drava and Danube rivers as they meander through Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia.

It’s the biggest protected river area in Europe, covering over 400 miles of waterways, and I’ve got my eye on a couple of areas in Croatia and along its border with Serbia. The first is Kopački Rit nature park, a huge area of wetlands between the Drava and Danube rivers by the Serbian border. You can take a small boat tour along its waterways to watch the birdlife, and hire a bike to cycle along the park’s beautifully flat trails. You could also hop across the border into Serbia and hike through the forested trails of Gornje Podunavlje nature reserve which runs along the Danube.

The second area isn’t quite so well known to British visitors. Where the Mura meets the Drava river by the Hungarian border near the village of Legrad, there’s the specially protected nature reserve of Veliki Pažut, where a solar-powered boat runs along the river to spot rare birds, including the little tern. I’d then hire a bike and cycle along the Drava and head inland along the old Iron Curtain EV13 bike trail to the pretty baroque town of Koprivnica. I’d carry on to the village of Hlebine, birthplace of Croatian naive art, which I’ve always found fascinating. And then finish with a swim in Šoderica, a lake formed by the Drava, and a cold beer in one of the lakeside cafes.

Red wine and Roman ruins in Tarragona

Photograph: Bep-Salvia/Getty Images

Once the capital of Roman Spain, Tarragona tends to get overlooked, but there’s something for everyone in this elegant Mediterranean city, from ancient monuments to the bars and restaurants of the old town. The city was founded by the Scipio brothers, both Roman generals, in 217BC and their legacy includes a largely intact Roman amphitheatre and circus as well as the spectacular Devil’s Bridge aqueduct two miles north of the city. The city was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2000.

The town is dominated by a 13th-century cathedral, built on the site of a mosque and before that a Roman temple. Unlike Barcelona’s gothic quarter, Tarragona old town hasn’t been lost to tourism. There are excellent restaurants serving local specialities such as romesco de peix, a Catalan fish stew. It’s also a treat to eat in the restaurants by the port, where the fish is cooked more or less straight off the boat.

People associate the region with cava, Catalonia’s sparkling wine, but some of Spain’s best reds also come from Tarragona, notably priorat and montsant, and the local Yzaguirre vermouth makes a great aperitif.

Tarragona also has a fine city beach, Platja del Miracle. A nine-mile coastal walk runs along beaches and through umbrella pines to Altafulla, a good lunch stop before catching a train back to the city. Those with strong stomachs and no fear of heights might prefer the Port Aventura theme park and its 65mph rollercoaster.

Trains to Tarragona leave from Barcelona Passeig de Gràcia every half-hour, taking time 1¼ hours

Celebrate the 1,900th birthday of Hadrian’s Wall

Photograph: David Taylor Photography : :/Alamy

This year marks exactly 19 centuries since Emperor Hadrian oversaw the start of work on the 73-mile wall to guard the Roman empire’s remote north-western border – and a year-long festival is planned to celebrate. From the banks of the Tyne in Newcastle to the Solway Firth, west of Carlisle, this Unesco-listed frontier has a national trail tracking it from coast to coast.

You can walk beside sections of wall or follow its former course, snaking over grassy hills, past turrets, milecastles and whole Roman towns. There are huge views across the landscapes of Northumberland and Cumbria from ruins like Housesteads fort with its barracks, hospital and communal loos. Fragments of ancient life here – a hobnailed leather shoe or a bowl with a carved soldier’s name – survive in the museum.

Hadrian’s Wall 1900 Festival kicks off in late January and will include new site-specific artworks, summer evening concerts, re-enactments, walks, Roman-themed light trails and a travelling Saturnalia. It’s a great time to explore – I intend to walk it in stages over the course of the year.

Rock up at a skyscraping wooden hotel on the east coast

Photograph: Kristofer Samuelsson

International visitors usually head for Sweden’s big southern cities or the mountainous north, where local companies offer a flurry of wintry outdoor experiences, from ice-carving to snowy horseback safaris. But it’s sometimes the less obvious destinations that offer a true taste of Sweden. Take Skellefteå, 430 miles north of Stockholm along the sand-fringed east coast. By international standards, this former gold-mining outpost is tiny, with a population smaller than Scunthorpe’s.

Its eco-credentials are world class, though: Skellefteå is leading the way in sustainable timber construction, and The Wood Hotel (doubles from £150 B&B), with Scandi-minimal and a rooftop terrace, has just opened inside a new cultural centre. This 20-storey architectural triumph is one of the world’s tallest timber buildings, with epic views of the surrounding forests.

Skellefteå is not a tourist hub, but it should be. During winter you might see the northern lights, and there are tons of eco-friendly activities to try in the forests nearby, from hiking to elk-spotting. Photographers can snap golden eagles in the wild right through until March, and in summer pristine beaches are perfect for evening swims.

Brittany’s enchanting coastline and seaweed spas

Brignogan-Plages Photograph: Alamy

On a fine sand beach in the small seaside town of Brignogan-Plages on Finistère’s dramatic north coast, Hôtel de la Mer (doubles from €90 room-only) reinvented itself as an ecologically responsible hotel in 2016.

The spacious 18-room residence is warmed and powered by renewable energy; it harvests rainwater and recycles as much as possible; and its owners are passionate about the local crop – seaweed. With foraging workshops, seaweed-based spa treatments and seaweed-themed menus in the restaurant, there is much to enjoy, but it is the hotel’s position on this enchanting and little-visited coastline that steals the show.

After a day exploring Finistère’s pretty islands and broad sweeping Atlantic beaches, head back to the hotel for a drink, then enjoy a pre-dinner paddle among the rocks in the shallows as the tide creeps in, enjoying the stillness of the evening. And as this region is just an overnight ferry ride away – on Brittany Ferries’ Plymouth-to-Roscoff route – the journey there is stress-free.

The huge greenhouse domes that form the Eden Project have gardens inside and out: valleys of spring bulbs, hothouse-pungent rainforests, an oasis of rose and jasmine, and a treetop walkway overlooking palms and papayas.

Eden has just announced a new 55-metre-long living artwork. An autumn-planted, bee-friendly Pollinator Pathmaker by artist Alexandra Ginsberg will be a permanent installation, due to be in flower for human and insect visitors by June.

You can arrive by train at St Austell station and catch the new Daytripper bus or cycle four miles through wooded valleys. St Austell is also an easy bus or bike ride from sandy beaches, village pubs and the subtropical Lost Gardens of Heligan. It’s a five-minute stroll from the station to St Austell’s Victorian brewery, where seagulls call, the air is heavy with hops and tasting tours have just restarted.

Unwind in a hot seaweed bath in County Waterford

Photograph: Andrea Pistolesi/Getty Images

Waterford is curiously overlooked and under-appreciated as a destination. The star destinations of Dublin, Kerry and Galway grab the headlines and by far the greater number of visitors, but the small southern county has an abundance of attractions – and some serious sustainable travel credentials.

From historic, walkable and rapidly regenerating Waterford City – recently voted “best place to live in Ireland” in the Irish Times – venture out on the Waterford Greenway, the country’s longest dedicated cycling and walking trail, which runs for 28 miles to Dungarvan using a former railway track that features 11 bridges, three viaducts and a 400-metre tunnel.

Alternatively, hug the scenic and secluded Copper Coast, a 15-mile stretch of rugged shoreline between Tramore and Dungarvan that is one of only three Irish Unesco-designated Geoparks. Stop off for seaweed foraging, tastings and beach picnics with Marie Power, or the Sea Gardener (three-hour trips €35). A little further on at Helvick pier is Sólás Na Mara, a wellness centre offering one of Ireland’s oldest natural therapies – hot seaweed baths.

Lismore, in the west, is possibly the prettiest town in Ireland and celebrated for its charming cathedral, imposing castle and beautiful River Blackwater views; downstream, in Villierstown, is Blackwater Eco Tours, a not-for-profit community enterprise that has four family-size eco-pods (from €95) and activities such as self-drive boats and canoeing.



Hikers heading to the peaks, plateaux, moorlands and corrie lakes of the unexplored Comeragh and Knockmealdown mountains should stay at Nire Valley Eco Camp (from €125 a night for two) which boasts five “bedrooms in a meadow” – stylish solar-powered cabins with dedicated wetlands to process wastewater.

“People who stay with us soon realise that Waterford has this fabulous mix of mountains and sea, woodlands and rivers – all within easy reach of each other,” says Hilary Britton, owner of the Getaway (pitches from €20), a new motorhome and glamping eco-park near Dungarvan that provides “clear-conscience camping”. Britton adds: “For most visitors to Ireland, it’s a forgotten county.”

Lech-Zurs aims for more sustainable skiing breaks

As a sector that will be hugely affected by global warming, the ski industry is making progress towards a more sustainable model.

Pyha, in Finland’s eastern Lapland, wants to become the world’s “cleanest” ski area, and was the first Scandinavian resort to go carbon neutral, back in 2011. Laax, in Switzerland, wants to do the same by 2030 – making the entire resort self-sufficient, not just the mountain infrastructure of lifts and restaurants; many resorts, including Ishgl in the Austrian Tirol, have already achieved this. In Italy’s Trentino region, Pejo 3000 claimed it was the “world’s first plastic-free ski resort” when it banned disposable plastic in 2019.

Also aiming to impress with its eco credentials, and with an epic ski area to boot, is Lech-Zurs in Austria’s Arlberg. Depending on Covid restrictions, it’s worth a visit in 2022. Linked to St Anton, which has some of the best off-piste riding in Europe, and with its own extensive freeride terrain (which gets tracked out far less rapidly thanks to the popularity of long lunches at its mountain restaurants), it is working hard on the green front. The number of guest beds is capped at 10,000 to curtail development, lift pass numbers have been limited, local biomass heaters provide heat and communal hot water, and so on.

On the white front there’s plenty of steep off-piste, cruisy pistes to tiny mountain villages, plus shopping for traditional Austrian boots and clothes on Lech’s twinkling main drag. The Alpenland hotel (doubles from €195 half-board) is great value, but better still, escape the glitz in the peaceful riverside hamlet of Zug, staying maybe at the family-run Schafberg (doubles from €125 B&B). Riding a classic off-piste route that drops 1,000 vertical metres from the Madloch-Joch to Zug is a pleasure one hopes will continue.

The nearest station is Langen am Arlberg (trains from Innsbruck and Munich) or St Anton (trains from Zurich), both linked by bus

"Israel Detects World’s First Case Of ‘Florona’ Disease, A Double Infection Of Covid-19 & Influenza","Share Tweet Follow us on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest stories and updates daily.

The first ever case of ‘Florona’ disease or a double infection of both Covid-19 and influenza has been detected in Israel recently that has caused concerns within the world health community due to its serious risk to the body’s immune system.

As reported by news18, the first Florona case was recorded earlier this week in a pregnant woman in Israel who was admitted to the Rabin Medical Centre to give birth. It is reported that the woman was not vaccinated.

The news of the Florona disease comes at a time when the world is seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases due to the Omicron variant. Recently, countries such as the United States, France and United Kingdom have seen record high Covid-19 infection rates and hospitalisation due to the spread of the new variant.

Florona itself is not a new Covid-19 variant but instead the simultaneous infection of both Coronavirus and influenza. However, this disease could pose a serious health risk as according to Dr Nahla Abdel Wahab, a doctor at Cairo University Hospital, Florona could potentially indicate a major breakdown of the immunity system as two viruses are entering the human body at the same time.

Furthermore, following the discovery of Florona, Israel said that it is currently studying the new disease as the country is currently seeing a surge in influenza cases. The country has been one of the first in the world to have its population vaccinated against Covid-19 and has recently already begun administering fourth vaccine shots against the virus to individuals with a compromised immune system.

A better you in 2022?

Health tops of the list of New Year resolutions worldwide.

As the pandemic marches on, there is no surprise that we are already thinking of ways to make meaningful improvements to our health.

Good news – the beginning of a New Year is the ideal time to initiate change for the next 365 days.

Here is the bad news – approximately half of New Year resolutions fall by the wayside after one month.

Turns out it takes more than will power on January 1st to maintain a new habit. Sustained change is likely when resolutions are realistic, specific and meaningful to you. Equally important are resolutions that are achievable over a period of time and take into consideration your current environment and resources.

Here are 5 non- traditional Bajan Health resolutions for a healthier 2022.

Eat Local – Produce has the most nutrients when it is freshly picked; the less time it takes to get from farm to table, the higher the nutritional value. Shopping at our local markets is one the best ways to ensure you benefit from the freshest produce. Ground provisions such as sweet potatoes, yams, cassavas and local fruits such as golden apples, mangoes and soursops are economical and can be found at Cheapside and other popular markets.

Get Outdoors – Barbados has numerous outdoor spaces for exercise. Take a walk along Brandon’s Beach, jog on Hastings Board Walk or hike across the hills of the East Coast. Make physical fitness a year round activity and you tend not to even realise you are burning calories. Be sure to include North Point, Bathsheba, Cherry Tree Hill, Botanical Gardens and Shark Hole.

Check your finances – Financial stress can take a serious toll on your health. A proactive approach can alleviate much of the anxiety around money matters and put you in a better position to reach your goals. Make an appointment to meet with your representative from your Bank or Credit Union to discuss your goals and obligations.

Choose a Charity: Bajans open their heart at Christmas, this is seen through an out pouring of charitable donations and an increase in volunteerism. Many share how good it feels to give back, that’s because giving is good for your health. Studies show that any act of altruism — a selfless act for others — is connected to positive physical and mental effects. This includes lower blood pressure, increased self-esteem, less incidence of depression, lower stress levels and greater happiness.

Develop a spiritual practice – Ringing in the New Year at church is inherently Bajan and for good reason. A spiritual practice has proven benefits of lifting our mood and creating a sense of steadiness in the midst of change. It also provides a valuable sense of community which helps people cope with unwanted change, illness and other life stressors. Spiritual practices include prayer, meditation, chanting, breathing exercises and ceremonies or rituals. The key is to do it consistently.

‘Cultural resources are not a renewable thing for us.’,"Renewable Energy ‘Cultural resources are not a renewable thing for us.’ The West’s largest green energy storage project would destroy a Yakama sacred site. Now, the nation is fighting back.

Jeremy Takala, a Yakama citizen, was fishing for sockeye and summer chinook a few years ago, just downstream from the John Day Dam on the Columbia River. He was accompanied by a Yakama elder, who pointed to a high ridge towering above them covered in juniper bushes, shrubs and grasses that plunged dramatically into the river over 2,000 feet below. The site is called Pushpum, or Juniper Point, and it is remembered in Yakama legend as a place of refuge for the members of Kah-milt-pa, or the Rock Creek Band. The Yakama, who consider the area sacred, use it for ceremonies and for collecting almost three dozen different kinds of roots, flowers and shrubs.

Takala listened as the elder recounted the area’s history and explained the importance of the plants. “I remember him telling me that I have to keep fighting to protect that mountain for the future generations, so that they can continue to gather the first foods and medicines,” Takala said.

Now the site, located 20 miles south of Goldendale, Washington, is imperiled. Boston-based Rye Development is eyeing it for the West’s largest pumped hydropower storage project, a kind of giant battery that would help the Northwest decarbonize its power grid. And that raises a fundamental question: Will the renewable energy revolution break with the fossil fuel industry’s long history of ignoring treaty rights for the sake of development — or will it become yet another venue for environmental injustice?

Northwestern states have made ambitious pledges to reduce their fossil fuel dependence. That means that thousands of megawatts of coal and gas power will have to be replaced across the region, requiring a huge amount of new energy construction — and land. Washington’s State Energy Strategy estimates that by the middle of the century, the state will need at least 12 gigawatts of new solar additions, 4 gigawatts of offshore wind, and 2 gigawatts of onshore wind. (The average size of a coal plant in the U.S. is about 0.6 gigawatts; the biggest offshore wind farm in the world, Hornsea One, can generate up to 1.2 gigawatts.)

The Columbia River Basin is key to this development; it’s already a renewable energy corridor, with 274 dams on the Columbia and its tributaries, which currently produce over half of the Northwest’s electricity, and hundreds of wind turbines that line the area’s steep river banks and gorges. Counties like Klickitat, where the Goldendale project would be located, have sought to attract and expedite renewable energy development by, for example, conducting feasibility studies for projects such as pumped energy storage.

In 2017, Rye Development approached Klickitat County and the local public utility district to see if it could secure the necessary water rights and land leases. Situated on over 680 acres of land, most of which is owned by a company in charge of a defunct aluminum smelter by the river, the $2 billion project would consist of two 60-acre reservoirs, separated by 2,100 feet of elevation and a tunnel fitted with turbines. During times of excess energy, water would be pumped up to the higher reservoir. And during times of high demand when solar or wind energy aren’t available, water would be released to the lower reservoir, generating power as it flows through the turbines. According to Rye, it could store 1.2 gigawatts of energy — a significant chunk of Washington’s clean power needs.

THE CONFEDERATED TRIBES and Bands of the Yakama Nation strongly oppose the project. Constructing the storage system would essentially destroy Pushpum: The place would have to be blasted to create the two reservoirs and to carve a tunnel through the hillside. This would irreversibly damage or impact at least nine culturally significant sites found in the Pushpum area, including important archaeological and ceremonial areas, burial petroglyphs, and fishing and food-gathering locations, according to a cultural resources study the Yakama conducted in 2019 as well as several other previous assessments.

“We do want to see green energy projects because we’re salmon people, and we know that climate change is real,” said Phil Rigdon, superintendent of the Yakama Nation’s Natural Resources Department. “But we don’t want them on the backs of the resources we depend upon.”

It’s not the first time the nation has been asked to sacrifice important cultural sites for the greater good of the state, said Takala, an elected Yakama Nation councilmember who serves on the tribe’s legislative and fish and wildlife committees. The landscape around the Yakama Reservation is studded with what he calls “sacrifice zones”: Between 1933 and 1971, the U.S. built four major dams on the Lower Columbia River, including the John Day Dam, destroying fishing sites and, in some cases, settlements. The abandoned aluminum smelter is still leaking toxins at the site where the Goldendale project’s lower reservoir would be constructed. Wind turbines from the nearby Goodnoe Hills wind farm have restricted access to hunting and gathering sites. Proposed large-scale solar farms would further limit tribal members’ ability to gather roots, berries and medicine. Meanwhile, for decades, the Yakama Nation has been fighting for cleanup at the Hanford Site, a decommissioned nuclear production facility just a few dozen miles from the reservation.

The Goldendale project is also an example of what tribal members like Takala, as well as other tribes, scholars and the Government Accountability Office, consider a long history of inadequate and inconsistent tribal consultation. Around a third of Washington state falls under the Treaty of 1855, signed by the 14 tribes and bands that were confederated into the Yakama Nation. They ceded almost 11 million acres to the U.S. government, but retained the right to fish, hunt and gather food on those lands. Federal law requires that the Yakama Nation be consulted on projects that would impact its cultural and environmental resources.

“We do want to see green energy projects because we’re salmon people, and we know that climate change is real. But we don’t want them on the backs of the resources we depend upon.”

But that consultation is often reduced to a single meeting or an email rather than any meaningful engagement with tribes, said Elaine Harvey, a biologist with Yakama Nation Fisheries and a member of the Kah-milt-pa Band. The Yakama Nation has declared that the siting of the project is inappropriate since it first formally found out about it in October 2017, after Rye Development applied for a preliminary federal permit. The Yakama Council sent letters to Rye Development and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 2018 and 2019, noting the detrimental impacts the project would have on an irreplaceable cultural site and arguing that Rye’s application omitted crucial information, including the results of a 2013 survey that clearly identified the site as being culturally important.

The Yakama Tribal Council raised this concern when Rye Development first consulted with them in September 2018, but its concerns went unaddressed. Instead, the company agreed to hire tribal botanists and archaeologists to study mitigation options, even though the tribe has stated that mitigation of such a sacred site isn’t an option, and that having tribal scientists included in the project does not resolve their concerns.

Erik Steimle, vice president of project development for Rye Development, said that the company has gone “above and beyond” the federally mandated consultation process. But the baseline isn’t exactly high. According to the draft license application submitted to FERC in 2019, the agency wrote to the leaders of the Umatilla, Warm Springs and Yakama tribes in March 2019, requesting consultation on the project. Upon receiving no reply, they filed an internal telephone memo noting their attempts, and the permitting process went on.

THE YAKAMA NATION’S position is clear: Tribes should be included early in a project’s development and have significant input on the location before it’s finalized. “Only the Yakama Nation can determine what is culturally significant to us,” Takala said. “How do you define consultation. Is it just a checkbox?” If the tribe says no, Takala added, then the project shouldn’t go forward.

This would be a step toward a consent-based system. Today, even though the federal government must consult tribes on developments that affect them, the project can proceed regardless of whether tribes agree. Consent, however, would mean that tribes could stop developments that harm their cultural, archaeological or sacred sites in unacceptable ways. That’s the standard enshrined in the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, one that the U.S. originally voted against.

In 2021, 19 tribal nations in Washington, including the Yakama, wrote such a standard into Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s landmark Climate Commitment Act, which he signed into law in May. The bill caps and reduces greenhouse gas emissions and creates a fund to pay for clean energy projects. One section required that state or private developers secure tribal consent, rather than merely consultation, for energy projects that would significantly harm sacred sites. But at the very last minute, as he was signing the rest of the bill into law, Inslee vetoed that section.

The move was a “low blow,” said Takala, who provided input on the legislation, and it angered many tribal nations and their supporters, who felt that Inslee had courted them to help pass the bill and then tossed them aside. Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians and vice president of the Quinault Indian Nation, called it “the most egregious and shameless betrayal of a deal I have ever witnessed from a politician of any party, at any level.”

If Rye Development manages to obtain all the necessary permits, the Goldendale energy facility could be operational by 2028. But it’s just one of several proposed projects on treaty lands. And without meaningful consultation and consent, Takala worries that the outcome of the clean energy revolution will be no different than previous waves of energy development.

On Oct. 6, the Yakama Tribal Council met once again with Rye Development. That day, the council issued a resolution, affirming that not only did it oppose the Goldendale project, it would oppose all future energy projects that threaten, damage or destroy important cultural sites. “Cultural resources are not a renewable thing for us,” Takala said. “How much more of the land — our land — has to be sacrificed?”

Lakers News: Frank Vogel Expects LeBron James At Center To Become Normal Part Of Rotation,"While a large portion of the Los Angeles Lakers rotation was out due to health and safety protocols, the team decided to take a closer look at LeBron James playing the center position. It had already been seen in small spurts — to great success — but the lack of available centers allowed them to try it over full games.

The results were as expected from the early small sample, that James at center opens things up for Russell Westbrook and allows everyone more space to operate. Defensively, James also improves things, as he’s able to act as a sort of free safety, pressuring wherever the team needs him to.

Before getting into the benefits and drawbacks of James at the center position, Lakers head coach Frank Vogel praised James for making all lineup combinations look easy.

“We can talk about the space all we want, but he lit up Memphis with Dwight [Howard] out there screening for him too. This is just a LeBron James thing, and playing at a superior level more than it is about the environment around him,” Vogel said.

“Obviously he has a strong belief in our group, we all have a strong belief in our group and while AD [Anthony Davis] is out, he’s intent on doing everything he can to pile up some W’s, and obviously playing at an extremely high level.”

While Vogel’s point here is strong, there is no denying how open things are when James is playing at the five. The Lakers could be making it a more permanent fixture in their rotation as well.

“It’s huge. It really is. We’ll see how our season evolves, you know? I think the Indiana game is the game that stuck out for me. We may have done it prior to that some, but him playing alongside Melo in the centerless lineup or Bron at the five lineup, however you want to put it, during that stretch really showed us that this could be something that makes the game easier for him.

“He’s not wrestling so much and there’s more space for him to be a roller,” Vogel said of James. “There’s just a lot of positives to that and can we get away with it against certain matchups on the other end? Obviously when AD comes back, he’s gonna play a lot of minutes at the five and then we can play the smaller lineup as well. So it is a direction I think that we’re taking our team and so far we’re having some success with it, but we got to keep getting it better.”

There’s no doubt that James at center has come with success this season. They’ve used him as a full-time big man in two games this season, and they are 2-0 in relatively convincing fashion, with wins coming against the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers.

When Anthony Davis eventually makes his return, it would make sense for him to be the primary center, while James takes a majority of the backup center minutes. Dwight Howard could play spot minutes in matchups where a traditional center is needed as well.

It remains to be seen if this is how L.A. will approach things, but it’s starting to look like they’re seriously considering this drastic change of identity.

James discusses recent scoring outburst

James has legitimately been putting the Lakers on his back over the past couple weeks, scoring in bunches of 30 and 40 with regularity.

He spoke about this recent outburst as he turned 37 on Thursday. “I think anytime you lose a 25-point scorer or more, then I think everyone has to pick their game up offensively, including myself,” James said after the game. “And if that’s what our team needs then I’m OK with that. But along that road, I still take pride in being efficient. I’m not a guy that just goes out and sees if I can jack up a bunch of shots.

“I want to be efficient every single night anytime I’m playing. Along this streak I’ve been on as far as my scoring, I’ve been extremely efficient as well and I take way more pride in that than the scoring. That’s just who I am as a basketball player.”

A total of 245 COVID-19 cases – 105 males and 140 females – were identified by the Best-dos Santos Public Health Laboratory on Friday, December 31, from the 1 496 tests conducted.

The new cases comprise 41 individuals under the age of 18, and 204 who are 18 years and older.

There are 167 people in isolation facilities and 1 353 others in home isolation.

Since the start of the pandemic, Barbados has recorded 28 810 cases (13 655 males and 15 155 females) of the viral illness from 471 945 tests.

There have been 262 deaths.

Under the National Vaccination Programme for COVID-19, 155 952 people (68.3 per cent of the eligible population) received at least one dose. The number of fully vaccinated is 143 677 (53 per cent of the total population or 62.9 per cent of the eligible population). The eligible population represents those who are 12 years and older.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) chief says he is optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will be defeated in 2022, provided countries work together to contain its spread.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against “narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding” in a new year statement.

His comments come two years since the WHO was first notified of cases of an unknown pneumonia strain in China.

Global Covid cases now stand at 287m, while nearly 5.5m people have died.

Across the world people are marking the new year but celebrations are muted, with many countries wanting to discourage crowds gathering.

Coronavirus remains part of daily life: a disease that has shut borders, split families and in some places made it unthinkable to leave the house without carrying a mask.

Despite all this, Dr Tedros sounded a positive note in his speech, noting that there are now many more tools to treat Covid-19.

But he warned that continuing inequity in vaccine distribution was increasing the risk of the virus evolving.

“Narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding by some countries have undermined equity and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of the Omicron variant, and the longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of the virus evolving in ways we can’t prevent or predict,” he said.

“If we end inequity, we end the pandemic,” he added.

In his comments, Dr Tedros also alluded to low vaccination rates.

While most of the population in Europe and the Americas have received at least one dose, a WHO target of full vaccination rates in 40% of every country by the end of 2021 has been missed across most of Africa.

Dr Tedros has previously criticised wealthier nations for “gobbling up” the global vaccine supply, fully vaccinating much of their populations while others wait for their first doses.

The WHO has set a new goal for 2022: vaccinate 70% of people in all countries by July to end the pandemic. (BBC)",2022-01-01 12:00:08+00:00
Much has changed since the start of the pandemic. But the nation’s public health system remains fractured.,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Mask mandates. Remote classes. Outdoor dining. As 2022 dawns, it’s beginning to look a lot like March 2020 — so much so that President Biden sought to reassure Americans they would not return to those dark days, instead promising a future made safer by vaccines and tests. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Those breakthroughs, along with genomic sequencing that can identify new variants and the promise of powerful antiviral pills, represent a revolutionary assault on the coronavirus. But biomedical advances are only half the battle, experts say.

“We have seen it isn’t enough to have testing and vaccines; you have to have a public health system that can deliver testing and vaccines,” said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The country is at a pivotal moment, Sharfstein said, full of opportunity if the lessons of the past two years lead to a new focus on getting shots in arms, swabs up noses and pills into mouths.

But some experts contend that the imbalance between the country’s scientific advances and its public health response is starker than ever, looking back in wonder on spring 2020 when a largely compliant population submitted to wide-ranging restrictions.

“We are going backward,” said Alfred Sommer, an epidemiologist and former dean at Hopkins.

“People are infinitely less responsive now,” said Sommer, who has tackled outbreaks of cholera and smallpox around the world. “This is different from anything that any public health person I know would have predicted in March 2020.”

When the most striking technological achievement of the pandemic — the mRNA vaccines — became available last winter, Sommer and others predicted the pandemic would be brought under control within months.

Instead, a year later, with little more than 60 percent of the U.S. population fully immunized with two mRNA shots or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson product, the vaccines are providing huge benefits to individuals while failing to fulfill their public health potential of protecting the entire population.

For anybody who trusts science, this is “vastly different than March 2020,” said Francis S. Collins, who in December stepped down as director of the National Institutes of Health, the nation’s medical research agency. But those who don’t trust science and haven’t been vaccinated are in a vulnerable place, he said, endangering everyone around them.

“People should ask themselves which group they want to be in,” Collins said.

In a recent Washington Post Live interview, Collins warned about the dangers of overlooking the lessons of this pandemic. On the research side, he said, scientists are working toward new vaccines and antivirals that will leave Americans less vulnerable to another pathogen that may come our way.

But that half of the equation needs to be matched by improvements on the delivery side, Collins said, by increasing staffing and funding for local health departments, many of which have been running on a shoestring. Officials in some local health departments still transfer data by fax.

There “needs to be a real reset button for the whole system to try to figure out how to be better prepared,” Collins said.

During the past two years, there has been little appetite for organizational overhauls to keep up with the evolving enemy — or prepare for future pandemics — according to Jay A. Winsten, director of strategic media initiatives at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The United States has largely relied on legacy public health systems. One example: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s external advisory board, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, typically makes recommendations for routine vaccines that affect small portions of the population — often children — rather than responding to the minute-by-minute shifts of a worldwide outbreak.

The “processes are designed for a very different moment,” said Ashish K. Jha, a health policy researcher and dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “They are not functioning well in a pandemic.”

The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.

Those organizational shortcomings are coupled with incomplete and sometimes contradictory messages. There was, for example, the early assertion that the general population would not need to wear masks and, later, a months-long disagreement among federal officials about the importance of booster shots, Winsten recalled.

Officials should speak with greater transparency about what they do and do not know, Winsten said, especially in the face of developments such as omicron, even as scientists scramble to learn more about that variant.

“What’s been missing all along, I think, is a publicly visible contingency-planning process that provides a window into the government thinking and advance planning for a range of possible future scenarios,” Winsten said.

The issue, Winsten said, is that misinformation fills the void, leaving local public health officials reacting on the fly instead of focusing on implementing the innovations that science makes available.

“What we have learned is that science isn’t enough; data isn’t enough; research isn’t enough,” said Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a health official from rural Wilson County, Kan., who has faced growing resistance. “We have learned all the science. How do we reach people is the big part.”

Funding from the Cares Act, the economic stimulus legislation passed in 2020, and other sources of pandemic-related federal support have helped with outreach, but the future of those funds is uncertain.

Nilesh Kalyanaraman, who became health officer in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County a couple of months before the pandemic hit, has seen the benefits of investing in delivery systems. The county has partnered with community organizations to provide health ambassadors who knock on doors in census tracts with the highest rates of infection to educate residents about vaccines and other public health measures.

A successful pilot program that was launched in May allowed the initiative to continue through next July. Kalyanaraman would like to make it permanent, bolstering public health measures for chronic conditions and positioning the county to respond more effectively to omicron or any other variant, by reducing the inequities that have characterized the pandemic.

“The question is funding,” Kalyanaraman said. Public health departments still haven’t fully recovered from the financial collapse of 2008, leaving them in a precarious financial position when the pandemic hit, he said.

“That’s what we are looking at — how to invest in the long term. I don’t have the answer for that,” Kalyanaraman said.

While the pandemic’s first two years raised awareness of public health’s antiquated infrastructure, those systems still had not been adequately revamped in time for omicron, according to Sara Cody, the Santa Clara County, Calif., health officer, who described developing homegrown databases to track cases.

“We are the health department in Silicon Valley, and we still get information about hospitalized cases faxed to us,” she said.

The biggest — and fastest-growing — impediment involves staffing. The politicization of the pandemic has exacted personal and professional tolls, even in Maryland, where elected officials have largely supported public health measures. Kalyanaraman said county health officers have been worn down by threats — and that he has endured verbal attacks in public.

Cody received police protection after a man was charged with stalking and threatening her.

After a particularly contentious meeting on masks in a school gym, McKenney, the Kansas health officer, was surprised when the sheriff’s department offered to escort her, concerned for her safety.

“This is my hometown, wow,” McKenney recalled thinking. “I kind of thought I might be shielded from that in my hometown.”

Beth A. Resnick, assistant dean for public health practice at the Hopkins School of Public Health, who testified before Congress in September, said her team of researchers identified at least 1,500 incidents of harassment and violence against public health workers nationally between March 2020 and January 2021. That included sharing private information on the Internet, death threats, protests, intimidation, even shots fired at employees’ homes.

By September 2021, Resnick said, more than 300 state and local public health leaders nationally had retired, resigned or been fired.

Complaints include fatigue and frustration with the hobbled infrastructure and the political attacks on public health, which limited emergency powers in some parts of the country, or shifted authority from health departments to elected officials or other entities, such as school boards.

“They have their hands tied,” Resnick said of public health officials.

McKenney said she sees reason for hope — though not in time to respond to the threats a new variant may bring.

She spoke recently at a conference of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health, where she was struck by the number of students who came up to ask about her work in public health. Their enthusiasm is reflected by a 40 percent increase in applicants to 2021 graduate-level degree programs compared with March 2020, according to the association.

But turning students’ academic aspirations into jobs in local public health departments will depend on sustained funding.

“Everybody gets it. They know that’s where the work needs to be done,” McKenney said. “The upcoming generation is willing to take on that challenge.”

For now, the short-term challenges keep mounting as fresh gaps emerge between biomedical innovations and delivering them to where they are needed.

Shantanu Nundy, a primary care physician who works with low-income populations, has been listening with concern to praise being heaped on the potential benefits of antiviral pills. He anticipates the next problem will be getting pills into mouths. Nundy saw something similar play out with self-administered tests, which he began advocating in March 2020 only to see tests remain difficult to access and often expensive.

The new antiviral medication should be taken within three to five days of onset of symptoms. And it requires a prescription — an almost insurmountable barrier for the 25 percent of the U.S. population who don’t have a primary care physician and others who would have trouble making a prompt appointment, particularly given the wait time for many test results.

“There is an implicit assumption that biomedical innovation will infuse its way into where it’s needed. And we absolutely know that’s not true,” Nundy said.

“Have we not learned anything in the past two years?”

Lakers News: Russell Westbrook Glad To Have Everybody Back Healthy After Battles With COVID,"On New Year’s Eve, the Los Angeles Lakers finally got a taste of what they might look like at full strength, getting nearly their full complement of players back around LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. In a 33-point win over the Portland Trail Blazers, only Anthony Davis and Kendrick Nunn were inactive due to injury or coronavirus (COVID-19).

The Lakers finally being healthy after a COVID outbreak ravaged the team allowed them to actually rest people amid a blowout. No one played more than 30 minutes — Westbrook and Malik Monk — a luxury the team did not have just a few games ago.

Westbrook, after the game, spoke about having most of their players back in action and what it did for them on the court. “It’s big for us. We’ve had a lot of those guys out and it takes a toll on your team and we need everybody on our roster as you can see, and tonight was a good night to be able to get guys back into a little bit of a rhythm defensively, and it was good.”

Frank Vogel also made his return to the Lakers bench on New Year’s Eve, something Westbrook was happy about. ”

Definitely. Not just Frank, but getting a lot of our guys back creates some time of normalcy for our team and it’s good to be able to see their faces,” Westbrook said. “Not just that, but to see them healthy, that’s the most important part.

“Going through COVID, it’s bigger than basketball, your long-term and short-term health. So just to see them healthy and feeling better is the most important part.”

Based on the results against the Trail Blazers, it appears that everyone is healthy and feeling good as we enter 2022. Seven players reached double figures on Friday, including James, Westbrook, Monk, Stanley Johnson, Austin Reaves, Carmelo Anthony and Talen Horton-Tucker.

And over the next few games, players like Reaves and Trevor Ariza will be able to improve their conditioning and provide even more impactful minutes for L.A. They’ll need it, as they’re only a couple of games away from their schedule highly intensifying.

Vogel happy to be back

Vogel missed six games in the league’s health and safety protocols, with the Lakers going 1-5 in those games. He spoke about his experience in isolation and how he feels now that he’s back.

“It’s something I really never want to do again,” Vogel said. “I don’t think I’ve ever missed a game as a head coach, so to miss six was challenging. Obviously physically challenging for what I was going through, but mentally challenging as well.

“Being in isolation, trying to help your team and your staff as much as you can remotely, giving input but also trying to empower them to coach the team and use their gut and their instincts and the whole thing was challenging. I’m happy to be back.”

Rasheed Hughes is once again the king in the sport of kings.

The 24-year-old jockey finished the year at the top of the standings for the fourth consecutive horse racing season with 28 wins from 126 starts to claim an unprecedented fifth title in the last six years for earnings of $669 824.

In what is probably Hughes’ best season to date, he also pulled off the coveted Barbados Triple Crown, winning all three jewels, the Barbados Guineas, Midsummer Creole Classic and Barbados Derby with the Andrew Nunes-trained People’s Champ.

His meteoric rise from his days as a 16-year-old apprentice and subsequent domination of local horse racing for much of the last decade have prompted some calls for Hughes to take his talent overseas to one of the larger venues. (NM)

De Peiza: Resist voter suppression,"De Peiza: Resist voter suppression

Social Share

Share













Leader of the Democratic Labour Party, Verla De Peiza, says some of the events over the last few days are “alarming to our democracy”.

She was referring to the announcing of a date for General Election on January 19 at a time when the COVID-19 variant Omicron would likely be established in Barbados, and then followed up with the announcement that people with the viral illness would not be allowed to vote.

De Peiza told Barbadians to “resist any whiff of voter suppression by this outgoing government”.

The full statement follows:

For a Party that claims to care, the events of the last few days are alarming to our democracy.

How do you set an election date when you knew or ought to have known that Covid case numbers were on the rise, that Omicron likely was established in Barbados – and then mandate that persons with Covid will not be allowed to vote?

Barbadians watch international news carefully and know well the efforts at voter suppression in the United States of America and must rise up to resist any whiff of voter suppression by this outgoing government. They know a low voter turnout will be in their favour.

Already the numbers likely to participate were set to be impacted by the elderly and those with co-morbidities who were shuttering themselves as a precaution. And given the round of partying triggered by the outgoing government since November last year, the numbers are expected to rise daily.

It seems as though the perfect storm of super spreaders was created, and then the incidence of Covid used to disenfranchise voters.

Fellow Barbadians, it took three years for you to realise that Mia does not care. The families and friends of the 300 plus who have so far perished as a result of her open border policies know she does not care. You know for sure before this election that you are NOT safer with Mia.

Put on your masks, walk with your sanitiser and go out in your numbers on January 19 and vote for change; vote for democracy; vote for your candidate in the Democratic Labour Party. (PR/SAT)",2022-01-02 02:59:04+00:00
Bahamas announces new measures for rising COVID cases,"Bahamas announces new measures for rising COVID cases

NASSAU – The Bahamas government has outlined a series of new measures aimed at curbing the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that the authorities here said is causing a fourth surge in the country.

Health and Wellness Minister, Dr Michael Darville said that among the new measures include the hiring of additional medical personnel; sourcing of new COVID-19 drugs; acquisition of Grosvenor Close Nursing Building for an Infectious Diseases and entering into a partnership with private sector labs.

He said in addition, the authorities will be offering free Rapid Antigen Tests for asymptomatic residents at multiple centres throughout New Providence and that there will also be distribution of free medical grade masks at vaccination centres starting this week in New Providence.

On Wednesday, the authorities reported that 207 cases of the virus were recorded bringing the country’s confirmed virus toll to 24 476. Most of the new cases were in New Providence where 192 were registered.

There was also one death pushing the death toll to 717. The Bahamas has 1 773 active cases.

“As your new minister, I have been working closely with health professionals in my Ministry over the past three months; preparing for the possibility of new waves of the virus and to better address some of the challenges we encountered during the difficult COVID-19 third wave.

“By way of Health Services Rules we have tightened testing at our borders to reduce the importation of new cases; while refusing to give approvals to mass gatherings throughout the country that can easily become super spreader events as the COVID-19 cases continue to rise,” Darville said.

He said one of the most pressing issues facing the healthcare system is the shortage of nurses, doctors and support staff.

“I am pleased to confirm that next week we will bring on board 12 additional doctors. We are also in the final recruitment exercise to add an additional 50 specialty nurses to our healthcare system. They will provide essential services and we pray that contracts will be finalized early next week.

“Our nurses and doctors have gone beyond the call of duty despite outstanding industrial agreements. I have spoken with the Honourable Prime Minister on these outstanding matters and I assure you, negotiations will begin early next year to finalise these outstanding matters and begin the long awaited promotion exercise across the board, at the Ministry of Health and Wellness,” Darville added.

He said that the country recently signed contracts to acquire new COVID-19 drugs, “including monoclonal antibodies, which have been proven to be effective for rapid recovery from the virus.”

He also reminded citizens of the importance of wearing masks.

“As it is recommended, regardless of vaccination status, you can double mask or wear a medical grade mask. Your government will embark upon the distribution of free medical grade masks at vaccination sites starting this week in New Providence.,” Darville said, adding “we know from the science that persons who have been vaccinated are less likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19.

“Vaccines are safe and effective against the severe effects of the virus,” the Health Minister added. (CMC)",2022-01-01 16:00:28+00:00
DLP confirms Moe on campaign team,"DLP confirms Moe on campaign team

It’s official!

Lucille Moe has joined the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) as a strategist for the January 19 General Election in Barbados.

The switch from the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) was confirmed tonight by DLP President Verla De Peiza.

“The Democratic Labour Party is pleased to welcome Ms Moe. It demonstrates that the Party is able to attract skilled patriots who recognise the importance of rescuing democracy,” she said in a brief statement.

Speculation run rife over the last few days that Moe, a former Senator and Minister of Information in the Mia Mottley administration had crossed the political divide, but neither De Peiza nor senior party leaders would confirm that Moe, a highly respected and successful regional strategist, had joined the team.

However after an invitation to Ilaro Court tonight for last minute efforts to halt the move Moe declared that her mind was made up.

“Contrary to what others have been speculating in the media, not everything is about money. Sometimes you have to know your own worth as a human being and there’s no price for principle,” declared Moe on her exit from the meeting with Prime Minister Mottley.

With 21 years of regional electioneering under her belt Moe is perceived as a ground game expert and was personal campaign strategist for the current Prime Minister in the St Michael North East constituency from her first victory in 1994 until her abrupt dismissal from the Mottley Cabinet in the 2020 reshuffle which also saw the exit of elected members of Parliament to make room for new appointees.

The Alliance Party for Progress (APP), a just formed two-party coalition led by Opposition Leader Bishop Joseph Atherley, took its first steps towards contesting this month’s General Election, registering 22 of its candidates yesterday.

With another “three or four” expected to complete the process of paying their $250 deposit on Monday, Atherley disclosed that the party had no intention of trying to field all 30 candidates. He said to do so would be a waste of resources.

However, he said that the public will have to wait until Nomination Day for the unveiling of their members who would be seeking office.

“We never intended to have all 30 candidates because we are not going to waste resources in this short, constrained period. The time is short and the resources are minimal and we are not going to waste time running people against incumbents like Prime Minister Mia Mottley or in other Barbados Labour Party (BLP) strongholds like St Thomas. When we merged we decided that we are not going to look for 30 candidates. There are about four constituencies where we would not be running any candidates, but we fully expect to fill all of the others,” said Atherley.

APP, which is a coalition of the Lynette Eastmond-founded United Progressive Party and Atherley’s People’s Party for Democracy and Development, officially announced its existence to the public on Thursday.

Atherley, who will be seeking re-election in St Michael West, after winning in 2018 on a BLP ticket, said he is confident that the newcomers will be seen as a viable alternative to the long-standing two-party system. He sought to remind Barbadians that when the Errol Barrow-founded Democratic Labour Party first came to power, it did so with significantly less than a full slate of candidates.

“We expect to have 26 but we want to wait until they are nominated until we reveal who they are. You have to understand that sometimes people pull out at the last minute and sometimes people come forward at the last minute.

“Those who are critical of parties that don’t have a full slate of candidates need only remember that the first time that Mr Barrow won, he did so without a full slate of candidates,” he added. (CLM)",2022-01-01 14:00:59+00:00
New federal law affirms Catawba casino in North Carolina,"KINGS MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) — A new federal law affirms the operation of a casino in North Carolina by the South Carolina-based Catawba Indian Nation, ending a yearslong dispute between the tribes.

President Joe Biden signed the The Catawba Indian Nation Lands Act, which was included in a larger piece of legislation authorizing military spending , on Monday.

The Catawba Indian Nation will oversee the $273 million Catawba Two Kings Casino with plans for 2,600 permanent jobs and revenues for the tribe. There is already a temporary, preliminary operation up and running at the site off Interstate 85 in Kings Mountain, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west of Charlotte.

Spurned by South Carolina in previous efforts to offer gambling other than bingo in their home state, Catawba members sought to build a casino in North Carolina, citing what they call its historical and ancestral ties to land in the state. The U.S. Interior Department agreed in early 2020 to put 17 acres in Cleveland County into trust for the project.

The new law clarifies that the tribe, which has a 700-acre (283-hectare) reservation in upstate South Carolina, is subject to tribal gambling laws and affirms the Interior Department’s actions.

Catawba Chief William Harris said the bill was “the final step in a decades-long fight” to receive federal support for the casino project, The Rock Hill Herald reported .

The passage of the bill is a setback for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, which operates two casinos in far western North Carolina. The competing tribe sued the Catawba and the Interior Department in federal court last year to try to stop the Kings Mountain casino, but a federal judge sided with the Catawba.

“The courts have been reviewing the legality of the Catawba casino, but this legislation will end that process,” said Richard Sneed, the Eastern Band’s principal chief, in a statement. “We are disappointed to not be granted the ability to defend our position in the courtroom.”

Catawba officials hope the casino will help lower the tribe’s high unemployment and poverty rates.",2022-01-01 15:26:08+00:00
Farewell to Archbishop Tutu,"Farewell to Archbishop Tutu

The funeral mass for South African anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has taken place at the Anglican cathedral in Cape Town.

Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the racist regime in South Africa, died last Sunday aged 90.

In his eulogy, President Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu as “the spiritual father of our new nation”.

Tutu had insisted there should be no “lavish spending” on the funeral. He wanted “the cheapest available coffin”.

Family, friends, clergy and politicians were among those who gathered at St George’s Cathedral for Saturday’s service, which had limited numbers because of coronavirus restrictions. Tutu’s widow Nomalizo Leah sat in a wheelchair at the front of the congregation wearing a purple shawl – the colour of her late husband’s clerical robes.

Tutu was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991.

In the main eulogy at the official state funeral on Saturday, Ramaphosa described the archbishop as a “crusader in the struggle for freedom, for justice, for equality and for peace. Not only in South Africa… but around the world as well”.

“If we are to understand a global icon to be someone of great moral stature, of exceptional qualities, and of service to humanity there can be no doubt that it refers to the man we’re laying to rest today,” he said.

Saturday’s funeral was given a special status, usually designated for presidents and very important people.

Tutu had requested that the only flowers in the cathedral should be a “bouquet of carnations from his family”, according to the Archbishop Tutu IP Trust and the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.

His ashes are to be interred behind the pulpit at St George’s Cathedral – the Anglican diocese he served as Archbishop for 35 years.

It was earlier revealed that Tutu is to be aquamated – a process using water that is described as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. (BBC)",2022-01-01 16:15:48+00:00
COVID-19 outbreak in fly-in Ontario First Nation an 'extreme crisis': grand chief,"An organization representing dozens of Ontario First Nations is asking the federal and provincial governments for help after a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in one of its fly-in communities that has affected roughly one-third of the local population.

Appearing on CTV News Channel on Saturday, Grand Chief Derek Fox of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 First Nations and approximately 45,000 people, said one of its communities, Bearskin Lake First Nation, currently has 149 COVID-19 cases, including one child who had to be taken to a nursing station to be treated.

With a population of roughly 400 people, Fox noted that about one-third of the community is infected with the virus.

""And so you can imagine, should this happen in any city within our country there would be an immediate response,"" Fox said.

""So our concern is that, currently, they haven't heard anything from the federal or provincial governments, they have yet to sit down with the federal or provincial minister responsible for this, and they are relying on surrounding communities, which they're thankful for and grateful for.""

Bearskin Lake First Nation, located approximately 600 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont., declared a state of emergency in late December 2021 over the outbreak.

On Thursday, the Nishnawbe Aski Nation reported a total of 53 known positive cases affecting community members who were isolating in 25 homes. The community is in lockdown and is only permitting essential travel.

The Nishnawbe Aski Nation made an appeal to the federal and provincial governments on Thursday, saying in a statement that the situation in Bearskin Lake First Nation, as well as the sudden increase in positive cases in other communities, is ""very alarming and requires an urgent response.""

At the time, the Nishnawbe Aski Nation was aware of 89 active cases in nine of its communities, including Fort Albany, Ginoogaming, Moose Factory, Sandy Lake, Poplar Hill, Lac Seul, Bearskin Lake, Kashechewan and Marten Falls.

Muskrat Dam First Nation and Sachigo Lake First Nation also have suspended all inter-community travel to help curb spread.

The Nishnawbe Aski Nation said many communities are losing their ability to care for members and have exhausted what limited resources they had, including drinking water and food deliveries for those in isolation, wood and fuel for heat, and measures that could alleviate overcrowding and housing shortages.

Fox said many of its member First Nations don't have a doctor on-call and instead, are using nursing stations to treat patients.

""We are extremely unique because we don't have that health-care system to support should someone get extremely sick,"" he said.

Charter flights are being sent out to nearby cities and towns in order to bring supplies back, he said. A lot of northern stores don't have certain items available, such as orange juice or vitamins, while groups such as the air ambulance Ornge don’t have the ability to keep a plane on standby, Fox explained.

""There's extreme concern should an emergency break out, should someone need to be transported, should someone be at that point where they might lose their life and they're pretty much on their own.""

While the organization has had a good working relationship with government throughout the pandemic, Fox said both federal and the provincial governments need to respond to the current crisis immediately, as the situation has grown desperate.

""Our concern is that currently with this crisis, there's just been no response. And there are pandemic plans within our communities, and our First Nations leaders are executing those plans well, but at this point, this is an extreme crisis,"" he said.",2022-01-01 15:14:00-05:00
"Curt Schilling explains why, if elected, he’d like to go into HOF as a Diamondback – Phillies Nation","Curt Schilling spent his peak with the Diamondbacks. (Dilip Vishwanat/TSN/Icon SMI)

Curt Schilling is one of the rare Hall of Fame candidates that you could make a case for being most associated with three different teams, which creates an interesting dilemma if the six-time All-Star is ever elected to baseball’s most prestigious museum.

Recent inductees Roy Halladay and Mike Mussina — who each played for two teams during their excellent careers — went into the Hall of Fame with blank caps. Schilling is probably the perfect candidate to go in with a blank cap, but that wouldn’t make for an especially interesting discussion.

In fact, Schilling says that if he had his preference, he would like to go in as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks, rather than the Boston Red Sox or Philadelphia Phillies. He recently explained to Rob Maaddi of Faith On The Field why that’s the case.

“A couple of reasons [led to that decision.] No. 1, the ownership of Boston is comprised of some very, very bad human beings that on the way out of baseball did things to myself and my family that I’ll never forget. I forgave them, but I’ll never forget it. And unfortunately, it severely tainted my experience. My experience here ending should have been one of immense joy, given what we were able to accomplish in the four or five years that I spent here. And it didn’t, because of what they did.

“And if you take Boston out of the picture, you look at where I probably made the ascension if you believe I’m a Hall of Famer, it was in Arizona. I grew up there … I spent most of my life there … and I think that for two years, what Randy [Johnson] and I were and did has never, ever been equaled in the game. So that was home.

“It was obviously Philadelphia or Arizona, if Boston is out. I don’t think I was nearly as good in Philadelphia consistently — I was hurt a lot. But it just came down to that. It had nothing to do with [Philadelphia]. Mr. [Bill] Giles and his family, we were always very close. The fans in Philadelphia were sooo good to me, and so good to my family. I’ll be forever indebted to them. But Arizona just felt like the right thing.

“And I mean, there’s a lot of Phillies in the Hall of Fame if you look at the Phillie Wall, and rightfully so. And Arizona, I was part of the first World Championship team in any sport in the state that I grew up in. So that was kind of how that came about.”

Schilling spent the largest chunk of his career with the Phillies, winning 101 games over parts of nine years with the Phillies, following forgettable early-career stints with the Baltimore Orioles and Houston Astros. But outside of reaching the World Series in 1993, Schilling was never part of a winning season as a Phillie, despite putting together one of the best two-year stints in franchise history between 1997 and 1998.

But Schilling is right, the absolute peak of his career came during the three-and-a-half years that he spent with the Diamondbacks. Between 2001 and 2002, Schilling went 45-13, posting a 3.10 ERA, 2.75 FIP and 16.5 fWAR. In both years, Schilling finished second in National League Cy Young Award voting, runner-up to his teammate, the aforementioned Johnson. Schilling and Johnson — a first-ballot Hall of Famer — were co-MVPs when the Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees in the 2001 World Series, winning a title in just the franchise’s fourth season of existence.

There also are quite a few people that remember Schilling for his four seasons with the Red Sox. Before Schilling went to Boston, the franchise hadn’t won a World Series in 86 years. They would win two in Schilling’s four years with the team. He finished second in American League Cy Young Award voting in 2004, and his “bloody sock” game in Game 6 of the ALCS that year is one of the most iconic performances in MLB history.

In the end, the Baseball Hall of Fame — not the player or BBWAA — makes the decision on what hat each electee will wear on their plaque in Cooperstown.

They seemingly were willing to honor the request of the late-Halladay’s family for his plaque not to only honor one of his two teams, despite the fact that he spent 12 years of his 16-season career with the Toronto Blue Jays.

However, the Hall of Fame doesn’t always go with what a player and/or his family wants. For example, Andre Dawson‘s Hall of Fame plaque features him wearing a Montreal Expos cap, despite his wish to be wearing a Chicago Cubs hat.

It’s possible that if Schilling is ever elected to the Hall of Fame, an already ugly process will continue as the museum decides whether or not to honor his wish to wear a Diamondbacks cap on his plaque.

All of this, of course, assumes that Schilling is ever elected to the Hall of Fame, which increasingly is in question. One of the great postseason pitchers in MLB history appeared to be knocking on the door last cycle, when he received 71.1% of the vote, just shy of the 75% threshold. However, after asking to be removed from the ballot, Schilling has already lost 12 votes from writers who voted for him a year ago. 2022 will be his 10th and final year on the ballot.

Alluri Sitarama Raju’s heroics need nation’s attention,"January 01, 2022 09:57 pm | Updated 09:57 pm IST - HYDERABAD

Revolutionary freedom fighter who gave sleepless nights to the mighty British Alluri Sitarama Raju’s 125th birth anniversary celebrations will begin on January 2, amidst the demand for national recognition for the revolutionary hero.

Despite being a household name in the two Telugu States, the ‘Manyam Hero’ and his battles with the British during the Independence struggle were obscured by time or history’s bias. His struggle is slowly moving out of the younger generation’s minds when the country is now, unearthing new war heroes.

The national bias is what annoys the old-timers who were brought up on his revolutionary tales. Recently, the Government of India had celebrated tribal leader Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as ‘Janjathiya Gaurav Divas’ and for the first time, the art and culture of the entire country’s tribal society, their contribution to the freedom movement and nation building, was being remembered and honoured with pride.

“Similar respect should be given to Sitarama Raju’s role and his heroics should be taken nationwide,” say P. Naga Raju, president and N. Nani Raju, general secretary of Kshatriya Seva Samiti.

They recall the unparalleled courage and valiant efforts of Sitarama Raju in leading a full-scale war against the colonial police and army in a tribal protest known as the Rampa Rebellion (1922-1924). This was against forest grievances in the Madras Presidency. Between August 1922 and May 1924, for close to 2 years, Sitarama Raju led one of the most intense uprisings against the British.

The fact that the British government had to spend over ₹40 lakh in those days to defeat the rebellion speaks volumes about the success of the Rampa Rebellion. At 27 years, Sitarama Raju became a martyr falling to the British bullets.

The Kshatriya Seva Samiti reminds how the awe-inspiring heroics were appreciated by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi. Many others have compared him to Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji. “It’s time the country recognises his role and the Government of India celebrates it,” says Mr. Naga Raju.",2022-01-01 16:27:28+00:00

When you wake up on January 1, 2022, there are two days left until the Browns take the field in Pittsburgh.

Here are the Browns Nation news and notes for Saturday, January 1, 2022.

1. Hot In Cleveland Star Betty White Has Died

Betty White, beloved actress and adopted Clevelander after starring in Hot In Cleveland, died on New Year’s Eve.

RIP Betty White 🤎🧡 pic.twitter.com/kh49kPH7AB — Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 31, 2021

Her kindness, wit, and infectious laugh will be missed.

2. Jadeveon Clowney Wants To Return In 2022

#Browns Jadeveon Clowney said he would like to come back to Cleveland next season but those talks haven't happened yet. — Camryn Justice (@camijustice) December 31, 2021

Defensive end Jadeveon Clowney would like to come back to Cleveland for the 2022 season.

Clowney signed a one-year contract for the 2021 season.

No contract discussions have occurred yet.

This idea has Myles Garrett‘s stamp of approval as he has openly spoken about his desire for the defense to stay together.

#Browns DE Myles Garrett on whether he'll try to convince Jadeveon Clowney to re-sign: I'll try but you never know. Guys have their own agendas and want to be in certain places. … But at the end of the day, I want this team to stay together.

The Browns need a little of that on Monday night.

3. Relying On Rashard Higgins

2021 ends with the Rashard Higgins mystery still unsolved.

He was a favorite target for Mayfield in past seasons so fans were excited that the team signed him to a one-year deal to continue creating that magic in 2021.

However, he has been missing in action this season.

In 15 games, he has 23 catches for 267 yards and 1 touchdown.

That touchdown happened way back in Week 5 against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt talked about Higgins yesterday.

With pretty much the entire wide receiving room injured at some point in the season, it seems odd that Higgins’ number has not already been called often if the Browns can rely on him.

AVP’s positive words about Higgins just add to the mystery of where he has been this season when the Browns desperately needed a receiver to step up.

There must be a method to the madness; maybe we will find out what it is in 2022.

How the OVP responded during pandemic’s 2nd year,"MANILA, Philippines — As 2021 came to a close, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) looked back on its COVID-19 response during the second year of the pandemic—from its swab cab project in support of communities with high coronavirus transmission to its free telemedicine program in a bid to decongest hospitals.

An episode of Vice President Leni Robredo’s Sunday radio show, “BISErbisyong LENI,” recounted the programs and projects undertaken by her office during the second year of the health crisis.

Among these initiatives included the COVID-19 testing efforts of the OVP in “hotspot areas” as well as the launching of an online teleconsultation service in a bid to decongest health facilities.

The OVP allocated over P45.86 million for 35,656 extraction and detection kits. Some 2,750 extraction kits were given to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.

Swab Cab project

The OVP also launched in 2021 its Swab Cab project in communities with high levels of COVID-19 transmission and infection rates in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.

Some P11 million was allocated by the OVP for antigen test kits. Under the project, 9,757 people were tested in Malabon, Quezon City, Marikina City, Imus, Tuguegarao, and Naga.

In June, the OVP launched its Vaccine Express project, which was aimed to strengthen the vaccination drive of local governments.

The program was launched in 13 areas, namely, Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental; Iriga at Naga sa Camarines Sur; San Pedro, Laguna; Magalang at San Fernando City, Pampanga; Capas, Tarlac; Malolos, Bulacan; Mariveles, Bataan; Catanduanes; and Manila, Pasig, and Quezon City in Metro Manila.

‘E-Konsulta’

During the rise of COVID-19 cases in April, the OVP put in place the Bayanihan E-Konsulta, a free telemedicine program that seeks to reach indigent and vulnerable families, decongest hospitals, and extend proper medical attention to those in need.

The Bayanihan E-Konsulta was started by OVP after observing that the country’s healthcare system was on the brink of collapse, with hospitals in the NCR Plus areas — meaning Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal — already in full capacity.

This led Robredo and her office to devise ways to minimize contact of possible uninfected individuals seeking hospital services by having medical professionals assess their symptoms and conditions virtually, through messenger applications.

The program had 4,271 external volunteers and 1,327 volunteer doctors. More than 45,990 requests were processed under the program while 9,556 were given COVID-19 care kits.

In 2020, the first year of the pandemic, the OVP put together a total of P505.3 million in assistance for COVID-19 response and another P35.06 million for disaster relief operations, including those for the eruption of Taal Volcano in January that year and the series of typhoons from October to November.

Mudavadi loses grip on Luhya nation,"43 SHARES Share Tweet

NAIROBI, Kenya Jan 2 – Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has been unveiled as the Luhya spokesman in a ceremony boycotted by several community leaders including One Kenya Alliance (OKA) co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula.

The new declaration by elders from the community effectively dethroned Mudavadi who has been holding the post since 2013.

The Luhya Elders Forum Secretary Peter Ludaba made the announcement during an Azimio La Umoja meeting held at the historic Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega County on the eve of the New Year 2022.

“The elders unanimously hand over Wycliffe Oparanya as the Western Kenya Region community leader with whom you will form the government and negotiate with, on the stakes of the community in your government,” the elders said, addressing Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga.

The resolution was signed by Chairman Patrick Wangamati, the Secretariat and patron Francis Atwoli.

Oparanya pledged to engage Mudavadi, Wetang’ula and other leaders from the region in a quest to ensure the region’s interests are taken care of in the next administration.

The elders further pledged that the Luhya community will only back the candidates fielded under the Azimio La Umoja movement, with Odinga as the community’s presidential candidate.

“We the elders of the Western region, noting that the country is geared towards a political transition, we, therefore, resolve and direct that the region shall be part of the Azimio La Umoja under the leadership of Raila Odinga,” they said in a statement read out by Peter Ludama.

During the meeting, Several MPs and MCAs ditched Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress (ANC) party for Odinga’s ODM, vowing to support his presidential bid.

Blockchain technology developments help elevate food safety protocols,"– CONTRIBUTED Opinion –

By Francine L. Shaw

Blockchain technology is not a new concept to the foodservice industry. Before the pandemic, those of us in the industry discussed blockchain technology, traceability, transparency, sustainability, digital technology, and food safety and its impact on the green revolution every day. Then COVID happened, and some of these discussions and movements seemed to take a back seat or even stop. Conferences came to a halt. Collaborations were complex — in the beginning.

Behind the scenes, many dreamers and developers continued to move forward. The average person’s typical day-to-day life had changed so much it gave those in the digital space more time to research, test, and develop new technology. And that is what they did.

Over the next few years, we will see technology trends emerge that we once thought were decades away. Digital technology is no longer an option. It is a necessity.

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. The most common of these are email, calendar services, and bulk email providers. SaaS products offer a complete software solution purchased on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. This service is the most prevalent way for most companies to do business today. We could say it is the hottest new trend of the past few years and it certainly is convenient. Before SaaS, obtaining information quickly and efficiently was much more difficult. The thing with digital technology is, there is always a history. You can’t erase it. Even if you hit “delete,” the information remains, and regulators will find it.

Wireless monitoring sensors that can control temperature and humidity will be a big trend in the upcoming year, saving companies significant money on food and energy waste. The supply chain has many moving parts, each with its own impact on the environment. The cold chain is no exception. The cold chain is estimated to be responsible for 3 percent to 3.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Considering 40 percent of all food requires refrigeration and 15 percent of the electricity used worldwide is for refrigeration, this should not come as a surprise. Cold chain emissions come from three sources: food waste, electricity, and of course refrigerants. BCG conducted a study that found a staggering $120 billion in food supplies is wasted each year because of poor storage and handling.

Blockchain technologies, something we have been discussing for a few years, are closer than we think. Transparency, traceability, and sustainability are vital to everyone in the industry. The FDA has outlined four core elements in the New Era of Smarter Food Safety Blueprint, and the first of these elements is tech-enabled traceability.

Traceability processes are critical to ensure all food items are traced and tracked throughout the supply chain. Traceability is essential for food safety as well as operational efficiency. With a solid traceability program, it is possible to locate a product at any stage of the food chain within the supply chain — literally from farm to table. For this technology to work well, it must be user-friendly and affordable to all — small businesses and large corporations alike. When it is available and widely used, it will minimize foodborne illness outbreaks and assist significantly with speeding up the process of finding the source if an outbreak does occur.

Affordable digital technology connecting buyers with validated verified sellers is at the forefront. This technology will reduce research time for buyers and assist with social and environmental sourcing, helping more companies buy locally with confidence.

SaaS restaurant assessment and inspection apps have become much more user-friendly and affordable. These apps can transfer valuable information to supervisors in real-time. In a critical infraction, the supervisor can follow up to ensure corrective action was taken, avoiding a possible crisis.

SaaS products have been a digital blessing to the foodservice industry. Data pipelines will continue to be an essential part of business and become even more commonplace as the digital world continues to explode. A few years ago, many people didn’t even know what data integration was. Now, I am part of the trend, assisting with the development of SaaS products that must have the ability to integrate.

Data integration has already become the backbone for many businesses because they allow excessive amounts of data to integrate from various sources. This data can then be extracted at different points to gather information and conduct analysis. This process is crucial because it means businesses can question data that has been processed to a specific point in various ways without starting over from the beginning.

And none of these trends would be anything without data analytics. I don’t know anyone in this industry who doesn’t love a beautiful pie chart or graph. Nearly every app developed has at least minimal analytics as part of the system.

Today, analytics and integration are key components of most foodservice products.

Surveillance database tracks what technology police use in NH,"CONCORD — As police gain access to increasingly advanced surveillance tools, researchers are constructing a nationwide, open-source database of technology to help level the playing field between the companies that sell equipment to departments and the citizens who pay for it.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Atlas of Surveillance uses public information and an army of student journalists to document the tools that local law enforcement use and the spread of equipment like facial recognition technology and drones.

The database contains 16 entries for all of New Hampshire. There are fewer entries in part because the state’s police are spread across many small towns instead of large metropolitan police departments that tend to generate more public scrutiny and reporting.

New Hampshire departments use three of the most common technologies found in the database: body-worn cameras, drones and license plate readers. The City of Lebanon maintains a camera registry, where private citizens with cameras like the Amazon Ring can sign up to add their cameras to a larger system of surveillance.

The database also includes New Hampshire’s Information Analysis Center in Concord, one of the country’s 79 fusion center sites. At fusion centers, where a variety of surveillance technologies can be used in one place, local and state law enforcement gather and analyze intelligence with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

An effort in neighboring Maine to close down its own fusion center failed in the state Senate last summer after passing in the House. A whistleblower had accused the center of illegally surveilling gun buyers, environmental protestors and employees at a Israel-Palestine peace building camp.

Dave Maass, the director of investigations at Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the Atlas of Surveillance matters because a power imbalance exists between the companies that market this technology to law enforcement and the people affected by how those technologies shape policing, even in subtle or unintentional ways.

“What we find in the country is that there is often this very cozy relationship between surveillance vendors and police officers,” Maass said. Vendors come to law enforcement conferences and try to sell departments on their miracle products, pitches that regular citizens don’t get to witness.

“A lot of decisions are being made about surveillance at closed-door meetings without input from the community about what’s acceptable and what’s needed for the community,” he said.

In some extreme cases, the public doesn’t get to know what it’s paying for.

Concord police’ssurveillance tech

One form of technology that doesn’t appear in the database is the “DEU Communications” equipment that cost Concord taxpayers $5,200 this year.

The business services budget line item also appeared in fiscal year 2021, as well as the budget from fiscal year 2020, when it cost $5,100 and was called “covert communications equipment.” The technology’s disclosure was the subject of a Supreme Court case the Monitor and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire brought against the City of Concord in 2019.

In an opinion issued on Dec. 7, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that the city could keep the vendor’s name and the nature of its service secret, even from the ACLU-NH attorneys arguing the case.

Although the city will not reveal what the technology is, Maass’ research indicates that it is likely a mobile phone service provided by Motorola-owned company Callyo, pronounced Call-ee-yo.

Callyo’s investigative products have a range of uses, including allowing law enforcement to mask phone numbers and record communications between victims and suspects. More than 30 U.S. patents associated with the company have names like “controlled recorded 3-way calling” and “virtual numbers for intelligence operations.”

“Using the virtual number, the operator may setup a controlled call between a victim and a baddie,” one patent describes.

In its promotional materials, Callyo says its products help law enforcement protect the most vulnerable people harmed by crimes, like victims of human trafficking and child pornography.

Concord said revealing the name of the vendor or the type of technology could potentially put police officers’ lives at risk. Yet, other departments openly disclose to the public how they use similar equipment and why.

Maass said that after just a few minutes of searching the internet, he was able to find nearly identical passages between the heavily redacted license agreement the city provided to the Monitor and Callyo’s 2016 privacy policy and refund policy, available on its website.

Callyo’s privacy policy in the 2017 license agreement and its archived policy online includes the same 11 sections detailing the company’s relationship with law enforcement agencies and how it uses customer data.

Although multiple companies might use similar clauses in their legal statements, there is some more unusual language in Callyo’s privacy policy, including a section on using the service abroad in the course of international investigations.

Concord Police Chief Brad Osgood declined to confirm if the police department used Callyo’s services.

“I’m not going to tell you whether that’s the product,” Osgood said.

Many departments that use Callyo do not keep it secret.

In fact, hundreds of other law enforcement departments contract with Callyo, including police departments in Davie, Florida; Richmond, California; and Seattle, Washington.

Under a 2017 city ordinance, the Seattle Police Department is required to publicly explain how it uses surveillance tools like this one that have a “high privacy risk.”

In 2021, the department released a public surveillance impact report regarding Callyo’s products.

“The technology can record all calls made to/from the masked phone, covertly record audio, as well as GPS locate the phone of a caller,” the department explained. “When Seattle Police Department utilizes Callyo to record conversations, the technology is used only with search warrant.”

When installed on an officer’s phone, Callyo’s mobile service can mask a phone number assigned to an existing phone and display a different local number while making calls, the report said.

When asked about why other police departments like Seattle might treat public disclosure of information about Callyo differently, Osgood said, “I don’t have any knowledge of what other departments do with products of this sort.”

In 2020, the City of Concord spent about $360 in filing fees and transcription costs related to the case. At the end of December, the city said it had kept no record of how much staff time had been used to keep the contract secret and by law, it did not have to create a record to provide that information.

How to build a databaseof police tech

The Atlas of Surveillance began in 2018 as a collaboration between the Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno. Designed to allow students and other volunteers to take on discrete, independent tasks, the database demonstrates how crowdsourcing can be used to gather large quantities of information.

Maass said the database now has more than 8,000 individual data points pulled from a variety of public sources.

“The three methods that go into the Atlas of Surveillance are three journalistic methods,” Maass said. “One is crowdsourcing, working with large groups of people to pull together information. Two would be data journalism, acquiring datasets and converting them into maps. And three would be public records requests.”

Since the database relies on publicly available information, it offers only an incomplete picture of what technology police use nationwide.

“If there’s not a reporter writing stories about it, we’re not going to find information about it. If there’s not a government website where they’re posting meeting agendas, we’re not going to find it,” Maass said.

However, the database already provides important information for researchers, journalists and citizens concerned about surveillance in their communities.

“It’s the largest of its kind right now,” he said.",2022-01-01 21:13:51

New Technology Increases Sequencing Power To Help Decode the Genome of All Life on Earth,"The Earlham Institute (EI) has boosted its capability in high-fidelity long-read sequencing with a twin set of the cutting-edge Pacific Biosciences Sequel IIe platforms to support the Earth BioGenome projects, providing the UK bioscience community with critical technologies for biodiversity genomics.

As the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) is gaining momentum to sequence, catalog, and characterize the genomes of all eukaryotic biodiversity on Earth within the next ten years, global efforts are underway to deploy the technology and infrastructure capable of rapidly delivering large numbers of high-quality genome sequences.

The Sequel IIe platform empowers scientists to take genomic analysis to a higher level of accuracy by producing high-fidelity long reads (HiFi) to resolve genomes and transcriptomes.

“The Sequel IIe platforms allow us to scale up our existing infrastructure in our contribution to BioGenome sequencing,” said Head of Genomics Pipelines at the Earlham Institute Dr. Karim Gharbi. “Demand from the UK bioscience community for higher-quality genome references is growing rapidly, with requests to access HiFi sequence data at an all-time high.

“Feedback from early adopters of the Sequel IIe across the genomics community has been extremely positive with HiFi genomes, outperforming existing resources by at least one order of magnitude. The additional platform will immediately double our genome sequence capability capacity, enabling continued, cost-effective access to HiFi reads for EI researchers and UK bio-scientists.”

In the past few years, the Earlham Institute has made strategic investments in genome-enabling technologies, setting the path for a new era in biology where high-quality, richly-annotated genome sequences are no longer the exception but increasingly the norm.

Director of the Earlham Institute Prof Neil Hall, added: “The Earth BioGenome project initiatives are highly collaborative but the technology and infrastructure capable of producing high-quality genomes at scale need to be ensured. The additional HiFi capacity at the Earlham Institute for the analysis of protist genomes strengthens our position in the global initiative as a leader in genome sequencing.”

These sequencing technologies support several national and international initiatives with the Earlham Institute as a core research partner – including the Vertebrate Genomes Project, Darwin Tree of Life (DTOL) Project, and European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) – delivering key sequencing data and analyses for a wide range of organisms, and underpinning ambitious program to catalog the biodiversity of single-cell eukaryotes (protists).*

“Key to this investment was the early adoption of the long, high-quality (HiFi) sequencing platform (Pacific Biosciences Sequel II) in 2019, before the Earlham Institute permanently acquired the instrument with support from BBSRC funding,” added Dr. Gharbi. “This technology allowed the Institute’s researchers to secure early success in delivering high-quality genome references for key target species and establish EI as a leading center in BioGenome research.”

Notes

*As part of the Wellcome-funded DToL project, the Earlham Institute is also leading the development of novel tools to build high-quality genomes from single-cell eukaryotes. Pivotal to this technology are platforms and pipelines for protist species isolated from environmental populations to increase efficiency and reduce cost of library preparation from individual cells.",2022-01-01 06:09:00-08:00

"Sci-fi types of medical implants will soon become reality, researchers say","Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

For decades, doctors have embedded pacemakers, cochlear implants and cardiac defibrillators into their patients’ bodies. More recently, consumers have started tracking their own heart rates and number of steps taken with watches, bracelets, cellphones and other wearable devices. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Researchers and doctors are now dreaming up more ways to merge those technologies, to move consumer-driven monitors inside bodies.

“We started to see this line blur with Fitbit,” said Amal Graafstra, who produces magnet implants and other technology through a company called Dangerous Things, which he founded in 2013. “When you start looking into medical applications, there’s going to be a convergence, and I think that’s going to be inevitable.”

In some ways, this is already happening: The medical field has fast taken to microchip implants, ultra-slim and flexible digital tags that can, for example, control a prosthetic limb. Such technology can also monitor the movements of Parkinson’s patients using accelerometers to detect tremors, which offers neurologists a detailed assessment of a patient’s physical behavior before they visit for their next appointment, aiding in the selection of appropriate doses of medicine. Researchers at the University of Illinois developed electronic sensors that can be embedded into temporary skin tattoos to track and stimulate brain waves to prevent seizures.

This technology offers the potential for screening before an appointment without having to send a patient to a lab for testing. It could also allow patients to always carry their medical records.

“The analytical laboratories will continue to do their job. But with the lab-on-chip . . . general practitioners and paramedics will have a tool at their disposal to carry out tests on the patient before going to the laboratory,” said Giuseppe Barillaro, an associate professor of electronics at the University of Pisa and the co-author of a study on bioabsorbable materials, which aid in healing and fully dissolve once the implant is no longer needed. He said that the technology is still maturing and the commercial availability for broad use is not available for all applications.

As health-care costs continue to rise, hospital stays have often been shortened and researchers are exploring the potential for ambulatory monitoring.

An example of this: A continuous glucose monitoring implant for adults with diabetes that pairs with a mobile app. It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2018. The system was created by Eversense and is operational for 90 days. The company hopes to create a sensor with 365 days of wearable time.

For now, users still need to prick their fingers for blood samples twice daily to calibrate the device, which also vibrates to warn patients of an impending or actual hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia event.

The implant, a small and thin white circular device, is externally located on the patient’s shoulder where a quick tap of a cellphone can give instant readings. The FDA evaluated clinical study data from 125 diabetics who used the device and found less than 1 percent of users experienced a “serious adverse event.”

Mirasol Panlilio, a spokesperson for the company, said that users have expressed a desire to make the device removable, if only to allow them a “naked shower” with nothing attached to their body, something the company is pursuing in future versions of the implant.

The tech has been slow to develop as fewer volunteers are willing to sign up to clinical studies, unlike vaccine pathways that draw hundreds of thousands willing to test preliminary doses, said Hubert H. Lim, a professor who researches implantable medical tech at the University of Minnesota’s Department of Biomedical Engineering.

Until now, Lim said hobbyists seeking to “hack” their bodies, like installing a magnet or the key to a Tesla in a hand, are the most willing to take the risks and try implanted devices. Implantable tech could cause trouble in situations where an individual needs an MRI scan or airport security scanners, he said.

Lim said that brainstem implants for young children have been around since the 1990s, and such technology is “very much integrated into our society.” He noted that such implants can complicate getting an MRI scan or walking through an airport security scanner.

“A lot of times, we can only try these technologies out in very severe health conditions, but are there other creative ways that are ethical and safe so we can move into that direction?” Lim said. “We just need more novel technologies. Yes, people don’t want things in their body, but I will say that what I’ve learned with deep brain stimulation, even hip replacement, is that it’s something that is scary at first but, generally speaking, people do in my opinion adapt to it as they see the benefits of it.”

However, now, researchers have created a smart food packaging that slowly releases microbials, killing vegetable-rotting bacteria and keeping them fresh for a while longer.



The smart packaging has been developed by researchers from Harvard and the Nanyang Technological University. However, what looks like yet another plastic alternative is actually quite environmentally friendly as it is biodegradable.

The packaging material is made via a process dubbed electrospinning where charged threads of polymer solution are drawn out into fibres. The crucial material in this is a protein dubbed zein that is a waste by-product released from corn starch or oils, during the production of ethanol.

To this, the researchers add plant starch cellulose and acetic acid. These were further infused with natural antimicrobial compounds derived from plants like thyme oil, citric acid.

Lab testing revealed that the antimicrobials are released in miniscule amounts from the fibres in the packaging material when it is exposed to either rise in humidity or release of enzymes by certain microorganisms.

By only releasing compounds when needed, the packaging can survive for multiple exposures stretching across months.

Testing this on a batch of strawberries, when kept under the smart packaging, they lasted for seven days compared to four days when kept in a regular plastic container.

Professor Philip Demokritou, Adjunct Professor of Environmental Health at Harvard Chan School explained, ""Due to the globalisation of food supply and attitude shift towards a healthier lifestyle and environmentally friendly food packaging, there is a need to develop biodegradable, non-toxic and smart/responsive materials to enhance food safety and quality.”

She added, “Development of scalable synthesis platforms for developing food packaging materials that are composed of nature derived, biodegradable biopolymers and nature-inspired antimicrobials, coupled with stimuli triggered approaches will meet the emerging societal needs to reduce food waste and enhance food safety and quality.""

Are you ready for the new technologies of 2022?,"Scientists are able to produce a digital twin of a human to improve their understanding of our complex body systems. Digital version of humans will be created by data generated by various diagnostic efforts.

New Delhi: Every few months, a set of new technology phrases and jargon dominates conversations and debates. The pace of change means that civil society has to be far more alive to new innovations which will influence its future.

As the march of technology accelerates, let’s take a look at what to expect in 2022. The Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) has identified the top new technology which will impact business and personal lives this year.

“The expert working groups identified the key technologies based on the three parameters and framework. All technologies were assessed on business potential; innovation level and take off stage opportunity,” says Shekhar Sanyal, Director and Country Head IET India.

Here are the main five categories of technology which will become prominent in 2022. These will impact nearly all sectors. Some are new ideas while others are significant improvements over current options.

IMMERSIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND METAVERSE: Be a part of every experience and activity. Even as augmented and virtual reality grow rapidly with increasing business applications, many versions and levels have created the overarching concept of extended reality or XR. Says computing firm HP, “XR tech takes the human-to-PC screen interface and modifies it, either by 1) immersing in the virtual environment (VR), 2) adds to, or augments, the user’s surroundings (Augmented reality), or 3) both of those (Mixed Reality).” In XR, X also stands for the new emerging technologies that will allow higher levels of realistic immersive experience. These will have applications in what is called metaverse, the digital universe. From independent pockets of immersive experience and digital activities, metaverse can connect all digital activities with each other. For example, from online gaming to medical data to travel planning can form a person’s metaverse. Each person can also engage with digital universe of others for a shared experience.

NFT/TOKENISATION, DECENTRALISED IDENTITY: The concept of decentralised identity will manifest itself in several ways. On business opportunity and take off parameters, this set of technologies ranks the highest. However, the regulations on blockchain and cryptos are yet to mature. Microsoft describes decentralised identity as “a trust framework in which identifiers, such as usernames, can be replaced with IDs that are self-owned, independent, and enable data exchange using blockchain and distributed ledger technology to protect privacy and secure transactions.” Collins dictionary has selected NFT as the word of the year for 2021. NFT means “A unique digital certificate, registered in a blockchain, that is used to record ownership of an asset such as an artwork or a collectible,” as described by Collins. Such tokens are a symbol of new form of identifying objects and people.

DNA BASED DIGITAL TWINS: Covid related research has pushed DNA based innovation to new levels. Scientists are able to produce a digital twin of a human to improve their understanding of our complex body systems. Digital version of humans will be created by data generated by various diagnostic efforts. Information from various devices will be stitched together and analysed for each individual. These will help predict and fight diseases among other uses. “Digital Twin Computing initially starts with the extremely accurate reproduction of real-world human beings and things in cyber space,” according to Japan’s tech giant NTT’s R&D division. “Digital Twins are already being developed for a variety of applications in different industrial sectors, such as in the automobile sector, for autonomous driving; the robotic control sector; and the medical sector.”

DECISION INTELLIGENCE, GENERATIVE AI: AI will get smarter and sharper. Gartner says, “By 2023, more than 33% of large organizations will have analysts practicing decision intelligence (including decision modelling).” Humans will work far more collaboratively with artificial intelligence for rapid and complex decision making. Similarly, generative AI will be a far more creative version of AI. It will be able to create using existing information and images. Content will be created at levels to match human output. Decision intelligence will be the improved version of AI, which includes social nuances, real world complications and humanised approach. Such AI will go beyond pure numbers and data-based results to concept-based output. The various biases built into AI will be mitigated by non-data inputs.

SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS: Rising investments and supportive policies will bring connectivity to every part of India. With all its efforts, India and other emerging markets will not be able to cover their citizens with existing communications technologies. “The global satellite communication market size was valued at USD 66.63 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% from 2021 to 2028,” says GrandView Research. “The escalating demand for small satellites for earth observation services in various industries, such as oil and gas, energy, agriculture, and defense, across the globe is the primary factor driving the market.” The corporate world will use satellite-based information at higher scale with applications like drones and GPS based consumer solutions. Such connectivity will enable the usage of all other technologies

"Brazil: Fossilised Eggs Dating 60-80 Mn Yrs Ago Belongs To Dinosaurs, Confirms Scientists","Palaeontologists, who discovered a nest of five eggs that got buried in loose sediment some 60 to 80 million years ago, have finally confirmed the origins of the fossils. Discovered by a research team in Brazil last year, the fossilized eggs were initially believed to have belonged to crocodiles, however, a deeper study has shed a different light. According to lead researcher William Roberto Nava, the eggs have a thick shell and were too large to be that of crocodiles and confirmed that the eggs belong to carnivorous dinosaurs.

The expert from the Paleontological Museum in Marilia also revealed that the eggs of dinosaurs and crocodiles also differ in size as the former measure four to five inches long and two to three inches wide whereas the latter measure no longer than three inches. Moreover, he said that a porous or smooth texture is a characteristic associated with the eggs of prehistoric crocodiles also called 'crocodylomorph' whereas the egg-shells of dinosaurs have a 'ripple-shaped' texture.

""The eggs are a little bigger than those of crocodylomorph. So we're associating these larger eggs, which are five, with some kind of theropod dinosaur, that is, a carnivorous dinosaur that lived at this point and used it millions of years ago to lay these eggs"", Nava said in an interview with g1.

How were the eggs preserved for so long?

Unearthed in Presidente Prudente city of Brazil's São Paulo, the transformation of soil into sandstone over time had a big role in preserving the eggs. Over a course of millions of years, the eggs got covered with layers of sand which turned into sandstone allowing the egg to withstand the test of time."" Who knows if in one of these [five] eggs we have a fossilized embryo. It would be super cool, it would be something new for Brazil"", Nava was quoted as saying by g1.

Here's another ground-breaking discovery of dinosaur egg

Earlier in December 2021, scientists in Ganzhou, China had discovered a perfectly preserved embryo of a dinosaur, which was at least 66 million years old. The embryo reportedly belonged to a toothless theropod dinosaur or oviraptorosaur, which is a feathered maniraptoran dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period.

"Tamil Nadu CM Writes To Amit Shah, Urges Centre 'upgrade IMD's Technology'","Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on Saturday wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and urged to upgrade and enhance the technology of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Chennai to ensure timely forecast of the weather, stating that it is unable to predict ""red alert"" situation in advance which hinders the preparatory action by the state.

Referring to the surprise heavy showers in Chennai on December 30, Stalin quoted extensively from IMD-RMC's bulletin of that day. ""By the time an 'orange alert' was issued at 4.15 PM that day, there was heavy downpour already in Chennai and 3 nearby districts, which led to the inundation of many places and total disruption of traffic,"" he said.

'Request Government of India to do the needful': MK Stalin

While the downpour which started in the afternoon lasted till late at night, the Tamil Nadu CM said the India Meteorological Department's regional unit had predicted light to moderate rains in Chennai and nearby districts.

""A timely alert from IMD helps the state and district administration to take up pre-emptive efforts to ensure the safety of people. We have, however, noted that IMD is unable to predict red alert situation sufficiently in advance giving hardly any time,"" Stalin said.

The shortcoming in the capability of the meteorological department to ""provide accurate real-time rainfall forecasting on instances like this is often preventing the state and district administration to take up timely mobilisation of the emergency management system,"" he said.

""In this regard, I request the Government of India to do the needful to enhance the capacity of IMD, Chennai to enable it to make predictions of high alert situations earlier and notify the same to the state government well in time,"" CM Stalin said.

The AIADMK sought Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin's immediate intervention to compensate farmers and people affected by the North-East monsoon instead of waiting for central aid. O Panneerselvam said that a relief sum of Rs 30,000 should be provided to farmers for crops destructed due to rains and Rs 5,000 to individuals affected by the rains.

ISS Astronauts Welcome 2022 With Orbital Badminton Game Aboard Space Station; WATCH,"The New Year has arrived in every corner of the world by now with the International Space Station being no exception. On this occasion, astronaut Matthias Maurer has sent his best regards to the Earthlings while recalling his orbital badminton match that he had aboard the ISS with a visitor, Yusaku Maezawa. Taking to Twitter, Maurer shared a 360 degrees glimpse of his game through a video shared by the European Space Agency (ESA).

Happy New Year! 🥳 Wishing you all a happy & healthy 2022! 🍀💫 Aboard the @Space_Station, we're also looking forward to a new year full of science, new experiments & hopefully more fun crew activities, like our orbital badminton match 😉🏸 https://t.co/JcPgdfpvFP — Matthias Maurer (@astro_matthias) January 1, 2022

""Happy New Year! Wishing you all a happy & healthy 2022! Aboard the @Space_Station, we're also looking forward to a new year full of science, new experiments & hopefully more fun crew activities, like our orbital badminton match,"" Maurer wrote in his tweet. Maurer revealed that the clip is dated December 2021, when Maezawa had visited the space station along with his assistant Yozo Hirano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin for a 12-day stay. In the funny video, Maezawa can be seen teamed up with Misurkin while Maurer was seen trading shots alongside Maezawa's assistant and video producer Hirano.

Maezawa, who had his first-ever space trip, surely made the most out of it as he conducted a gamut of activities ranging from arm-wrestling to skipping ropes in micro-gravity of the ISS. Earlier on Friday, the billionaire entrepreneur shared a video of him playing golf aboard the space station. In the video shown below, the billionaire introduced the viewers to what he called the International Space Station Club which had a golf course in a crammed module filled with equipment.

Maurer and his amusing posts

The German-born astronaut keeps his followers fairly amused with his posts as he keeps sharing glimpses of the everyday lives of the ISS astronauts. In December 2021, Maurer had shared a clip of himself getting a haircut in the space station, a post that wowed the netizens. Taking to Twitter, Maurer praised NASA astronaut Raja Chari who was handling the special clippers was assigned the job to trim Maurer's hair.

Step into the space salon where barber @astro_raja is a man of many talents 🚀💈💇‍♂️ Because none of us want hair in our eyes, or – even worse – the @Space_Station systems, our hair clippers come with a vacuum attached. Five stars for this space stylist's service ⭐️😉 #CosmicKiss pic.twitter.com/dDsXHaSgG5 — Matthias Maurer (@astro_matthias) December 19, 2021

Through his recent post, Maurer also introduced the people of Earth to a common routine aboard the space station that the astronauts are bound to follow for two hours. The astronaut shared a video of himself exercising in micro-gravity, an activity that is extremely essential to maintain muscle mass and bone density.

There's no exception when it comes to the daily 2h of exercise aboard the @Space_Station 🏋️ This not only serves to keep us in shape after the festive treats 😉 but is important to strengthen our muscle mass & bone density in the weightless environment of space #CosmicKiss @esa pic.twitter.com/WxbmvHuLty — Matthias Maurer (@astro_matthias) December 27, 2021

Alfred Molina Reveals How Doc Ock Was Different In 'No Way Home' Compared To 'Spider-Man 2,"After a long wait and putting end to several speculations, Spider-Man: No Way Home got released globally last week and has been declared as the world's number one movie currently. The movie brought back some of the fans' favourite characters from the previous Spider-Man outings like Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro and many more. Alfred Molina, who essays the role of Doctor Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, recently opened up his return to the franchise and compared how Doc Ock has changed in No Way Home compared to 2004's Spider-Man 2.

Alfred Molina Compares Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home's Doc Ock

As per ScreenRant, during a behind-the-scenes deep-dive with Sony, Alfred Molina opened up about his return to Spider-Man: No Way Home and shared how his character had changed since the 2004 movie Spider-Man 2002. He said, ""What I thought was so wonderful about [Spider-Man 2], the first time, was they gave Doc Ock this wonderful redemptive moment. And like all great villains, like a lot of villains in the Marvel universe, he’s become a villain kind of reluctantly — or almost by accident.""

He added, ""I knew that when Jon Watts described what’s going to be Doc Ock’s first appearance in this film, he just knows it’s going to be a moment of jaw-dropping awe. I wanted to make sure that I was in the right place in terms of the performance, so it was useful to go back and look at [Spider-Man 2]. But at the same time, it’s a different director, it’s a different movie, there’s a freshness to it, so I didn’t want to just come back and replicate what we’d done before. It was important to me to arrive as if this were the first time.""

No Way Home also saw the return of previous Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as they helped Tom Holland's web-slinger, and for the first time ever all three Spider-Man's were seen on the big screen together. The return of Maguire and Garfield was the subject of speculation, and Sony, Marvel and the cast attempted to conceal their involvement, despite numerous leaks. The film also features Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori and Marisa Tomei.

Rose Bowl returns to Pasadena,"PASADENA, Calif. — The Rose Bowl made a triumphant return to Pasadena on Saturday for an exciting showdown between Ohio State and Utah.

A sea of red swarmed outside the stadium before the game, as fans were fired up.

Former Utah football player Jeff Battcher flew from Macon, Georgia to tailgate.

“It’s the granddaddy of them all,” he said. “There’s no doubt this is the biggest event in any football player’s career to play here. I would have given anything to play here.”

Ohio State supporter Tom Murnane made a quick trip from Agoura Hills to see the sporting spectacle.

“Big Buckeye fan, so we go back to Columbus for all the home games,” he said. “Today all we had to do was drive across town for this one, so it’s great.”

After a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases canceled five other bowl games, some weren’t sure if the Rose Bowl would take place.

“I thought that this game could be canceled,” Battcher said. “But I was coming regardless, to be with my friends.”

“We were very concerned,” Murnane said. “Even two hours before kickoff, we’re still crossing our fingers and hoping to play.”

Utah’s fans filled up the stands, taking up more than three-quarters of the Rose Bowl seats.

“This is like a home game for us, you should see all the fans that are here,” Battcher said. “We’re going to dominate in the stands and on the field today.”

Yet the Buckeye faithful weren’t intimidated, as their squad made its 16th Rose Bowl appearance.

“I’m not nervous at all, we’ve been here a lot,” Ohio State fan Jack Doyle said. “I think it’s going to be an easy win, it won’t be a war but I think it’ll go well.”

No matter what side you were rooting for, it was all about ringing in 2022 with an American tradition.

“You don’t do anything on News Years Day except watch football all day long,” Utah fan Maddie Peters said. “That’s just the way it is and we love it.”

When it was all said and done, Ohio State defeated Utah 48-45 in a high-scoring shootout.",2022-01-02 04:09:29+00:00

Tori Spelling Celebrates New Year's Without Husband Dean McDermott,"After making headlines for their marital woes for the majority of 2021, Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott rang in 2022 separately.

The 48-year-old actress vacationed with their five kids — Liam, 14, Stella, 13, Hattie, 10, Finn, 9, and Beau, 4 — at Lake Arrowhead Resort and Spa.

“Happy New Year’s Eve 2021 … The kiddos and I were so excited to continue our family tradition since my oldest were babies. Love you @lakearrowheadresortandspa!” Spelling captioned a snap with four of her five children on Friday, December 31, via Instagram. “My parents used to bring my brother and I here growing up. I wanted my kids to continue that tradition. I can’t wait for my kids to bring their kids here one day! Thx @liammcdermott2007 for taking an awesome pic ❤️❄️.”

The following day, the “9021OMG” podcast host revealed she didn’t make it to midnight, writing, “In full disclosure I was in bed asleep by 10 pm last night. I know total party animal.”

McDermott, for his part, revealed via Instagram that he is “sick as a dog” and spent the holiday in bed.

“I am not going to let that dampen my spirits. 2022 is going to be awesome. 2022, we’re going to get through,” the 55-year-old Canadian said. “Wishing everybody much much love and happiness and success in the new year. Health, wealth and prosperity.”

He captioned the video with a similar message: “Happy New year Everyone!!! I’m down but not out!! Pneumonia sucks, but I’m not going to let it dampen my spirits!! I hope your 2022 is full of love, light and prosperity. Much love to you all. ❤️❤️.”

Spelling and McDermott, who wed in 2006, have kept fans questioning their relationship status for months after she revealed they slept in separate rooms and she was spotted outside a lawyer’s office holding paper that read “assets,” “support” and “custody.”

“There’s no trust there. It’s been building up over time,” one source told Us in November 2021. Another insider claimed that Spelling feels “trapped” in her marriage.

“They’re still figuring things out,” a third source said. “She certainly puts on a front at times and has yet to share details of what her plans are.”

Despite their rocky year, Us exclusively reported last month that the twosome spent Christmas together.

“They were all under one roof celebrating together,” a fourth source said. “That’s what mattered the most to Tori and Dean, was making sure their kids had a nice holiday at home together.”",2022-01-01 19:35:55+00:00
Andy Cohen Shades Ryan Seacrest's NYE Broadcast: 'Group of Losers',"Not leaving the shade in 2021! Andy Cohen was unfiltered (as always) while hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live with Anderson Cooper on Friday, December 31, throwing shade at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.

“If you look behind me, you’ll see Ryan Seacrest’s group of losers performing,” the 53-year-old Real Housewives producer said. “I’m sorry but if you’re watching ABC, you’re watching nothing.”

ABC’s broadcast included performances by Journey and Ashanti and Ja Rule in Times Square. During another segment, Cohen made it clear he wasn’t impressed by Arnel Pineda leading the rock band.

“We were doused with confetti from fake Journey on ABC. If it’s not Steve Perry, it doesn’t count! You get it? It’s not Journey!” he declared. “It’s propaganda! It’s propaganda! It’s not Journey! It’s not Journey! No, that was not Journey. Steve Perry is Journey.”

Social media users were quick to weigh in on Cohen’s antics.

“Andy Cohen calling Ryan Seacrest a loser might be the funniest thing I’ve seen on television this year,” one person tweeted.

Another fan wrote, “Andy Cohen calling Ryan Seacrest live (and wasted) on national TV a loser already won 2022 #CNNNYE.”

“Andy Cohen last night talking trash about ABC, Ryan Seacrest & ‘fake Journey’ is about the most punk rock thing @CNN has ever done. #NYE2022,” a third person tweeted.

A fourth viewer added, “CNN made the decision a long time ago that drunk Anderson Cooper, Andy Cohen, and Don Lemon was far more entertaining to people than Ryan Seacrest and company.”

Before he signed off for the night, Cohen made waves again for calling out New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

“Watching Mayor de Blasio do his victory-lap dance after four years of the crappiest term as the mayor of New York — the only thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is what a horrible mayor he has been,” he yelled as Cooper tried to cut his “rant” off. “So, sayonara, sucka! 2022! It’s a new year because guess what? I have a feeling I’m gonna be standing right here next year, and you know who I’m not going to be looking at dancing as the city comes apart? You!”

While the Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen host hasn’t directly commented on his headline-making moments, he did tweet that he was “a bit overserved last night.”",2022-01-01 16:22:09+00:00
"Kris Jenner Dodges Question About Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson","Not so fast Andy! Kris Jenner managed to escape answering a question about Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson with the help of Kylie Jenner’s daughter.

The 66-year-old momager appeared virtually on CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live with Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen on Friday, December 31.

“Everyone is talking about Kim’s new relationship with Pete Davidson. Have you had the chance to spend time with them? How are they as a couple?” the Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen host, 53, asked.

After Cooper, 54, joked that his friend is “always digging,” 3-year-old Stormi appeared.

“You have a visitor,” Cooper said.

“I know, that’s little Stormi,” Kris replied, picking up pregnant Kylie, 24, and Travis Scott’s daughter. “Hey, Stormi. You sit right here. Nice distraction! Good timing, Stormi. Perfect. Right on cue.”

While Kris noted that she was going to bed at 9 o’clock, Davidson, 28, was cohosting Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party with Miley Cyrus on NBC. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum signed off before answering Cohen’s question.

Davidson and Kim have been linked since late October 2021 after the makeup mogul appeared in several sketches when she made her SNL hosting debut, including one about Kourtney Kardashian and her fiancé, Travis Barker. In an Aladdin-themed bit, the New Yorker and Kim shared a kiss.

Later that month, the Guy Code alum and the beauty mogul were photographed holding hands while out with friends at an amusement park in California. When Kim visited New York City a few days later, she was spotted spending quality time with Davidson in his native borough of Staten Island. As rumors began to swirl about their status, a source told Us Weekly that the actor asked Kim to “hang out” — but not until they were done working on SNL.

“He was a true professional the whole time they rehearsed and in between takes, but afterward things got flirty,” the insider exclusively revealed. “They exchanged numbers and Pete asked if Kim would like to hang out sometime, which she agreed to straight away.”

Ahead of their time on the NBC sketch show, the duo had “bumped into each other a few times through mutual friends,” per the source.

Davidson was briefly engaged to Ariana Grande in 2018 before dating Kate Beckinsale and Phoebe Dynevor. The KKW beauty founder, for her part, filed for divorce from Kanye West in February 2021 after six years of marriage. The estranged pair share children North, 8, Saint, 6, Chicago, 3, and Psalm, 2.

In November 2021, Davidson and Kardashian were photographed holding hands following a birthday celebration for the Meet Cute actor in Palm Springs, California, confirming their relationship after weeks of speculation. One month later, a source told Us that they “are getting serious” about each other.

“Things have definitely escalated quickly but in a healthy, fun way,” the insider shared in December 2021. “Right now, they are just enjoying their time together and seeing where things go.”

Although West, 44, has made public attempts to win his estranged wife over, a third source noted that Davidson “is not worried about Kanye.” Ahead of the holidays, the rapper made headlines when he claimed that he never received any divorce papers from Kardashian.

“SNL making my wife say ‘I divorced him’ on TV because they just wanted to get that bar off, and I never have seen the papers. We’re not even divorced,” he said during an appearance on Revolt’s “Drink Champs” podcast in November 2021, referring to the Skims founder’s SNL monologue. “So how we — because [it’s] no joke to me, my kids want their parents to stay together. I want their parents — I want us to be together.”

Eventually, however, the businesswoman filed paperwork to become legally single and requested for her last name to be restored.

“The parties’ marriage has irremediably broken down. [Kardashian] no longer desires to be married to [West],” the December 2021 docs stated. “There is no question that the marriage of the parties is no longer viable. [Kardashian] has no desire to reconcile with [West] and wants their marriage terminated. Irreconcilable differences have led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage, and there is no possibility of saving the marriage through counseling or other means.”",2022-01-01 15:36:10+00:00

During a recent appearance on Clubhouse in the Trollz Nation, Wack 100 was asked to give his assessment of Kanye West’s church.

“He is not doing the preacher thing. It is all music it is all choir, and the kid version and adult version. There’s no preacher, I haven’t a motherf**** grab a microphone and preach yet,”said Wack 100.

He was later asked if they asked for Tiths?

“No, they don’t ask for Tiths, they have beverages and little snacks and things like that when you get there. Naw, he doesn’t ask for Tiths or nothing like that type of s***. I am not like the church type of person, but I will say, the set of it when you leave it’s like a mental relaxation. They are performing. They have them every week and you are constantly watching them sing and they are hitting these high notes. Where you are mentally finding some peace, and then it’s over. It’s real quick like an hour and a half.”

West recently spent more than $4.5 million for a drab house across the street from Kim Kardashian and his kids, according to People Magazine.

“It’s just simple logistics so that he is close to his children and has access to them at the drop of a hat,” the insider said.

He has also elected to tear it down and plans on starting construction on the property as soon as possible.

“Kanye’s new house is a teardown. He only bought it for the location,” a source told the outlet. “It’s near Kim and the kids. He has a vision for the house and plans on starting construction ASAP.”

He also had a surprise New Year’s eve Show featuring Future, Quavo and Justin LaBoy in the same city as Pete Davidson, who hosting a show with Miley Cyrus in Miami, according to People.

Per People, West is not giving up in his pursuit to try to win his ex-wife Kim Kardashian back, who filed for divorce last February.

“He’s not giving up without a fight. Kim is the mother of his children and he’s not going to just let that go,” the source said. “No matter if they’re husband and wife, they’ll always support each other. Her recent filing or any filing for that matter doesn’t mean he’s going to stop fighting to win her back.”

Kardashian has reportedly has been dating Davidson since this past November.

Andy Cohen 'Overserved' on New Year's Eve While Anderson Cooper Lands New Parenting Show on CNN+,"Both Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper ended 2021 with a bang!

The Bravo star, 53, admittedly had a little too much to drink while ringing in the new year with the network anchor, 54, for the fifth year in a row on CNN's New Year's Eve Live from Times Square in New York City on Friday.

""🌧 good morning! 🌧. Um, I was a bit overserved last night,"" Cohen wrote on Twitter Saturday morning alongside a woozy face emoji.

Elsewhere on Friday, CNN announced that Cooper will host a new show called Parental Guidance, which will air on the network's upcoming streaming service CNN+. The program will follow the host as he learns from experts about living life as a working parent to son Wyatt Morgan, 1½, alongside viewers.

Cooper's twice-weekly digital show Full Circle will also air on CNN+, which is set to launch in the first quarter of 2022.

There was no shortage of fun during Friday's on-air festivities. At one point, Cohen and Cooper took shots in honor of Betty White, who died at age 99 just weeks before her 100th birthday.

""We're going to raise our first shot of tequila in honor of Betty White!"" Cohen said as he prepared the drinks for himself and his cohost, who had just finished calling the late actress ""a lovely lady.""

""This is in honor of Betty White, a life well-lived. 99 years!"" Cohen said before the pair toasted to her legacy.

Later in the evening, after several more drinks, Cohen took verbal shots at N.Y.C. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who left the role at the start of the new year. Cooper attempted to diffuse the situation to no avail.

""Watching Mayor de Blasio do his victory lap dance after four years of the crappiest term as the mayor of New York [City],"" Cohen told the camera. As he spoke, Cooper attempted to interject with ""don't go on a rant"" and ""this is how you want to start the new year?""

But Cohen persisted. ""The only thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on is what a horrible mayor he has been,"" he said. ""So, sayonara, sucka!""

A stunned Cooper stared at his cohost and twice uttered, ""Wow."" A giggle could be heard from behind the camera.

Cohen continued: ""2022! It's a new year! 'Cause guess what? I have a feeling I'm going to be standing right here next year, and you know who I'm not going to be looking at dancing as the city comes apart? You!""

In addition to his Twitter confession, Cohen claimed he was overserved on Instagram in both a post and on his Story, noting that he still had a blast.

""I was a hair over-served last night, but man did I have fun! I hope you did too. Happy New Year everybody,"" Cohen captioned his Instagram post, which featured several goofy shots of him and Cooper from throughout the night.

The post also included a photo of Cohen and Cooper smiling side-by-side with Times Square as their backdrop.

Cohen shared a similar message on his Story before answering the big question: What were they drinking?

The answer: De Nada tequila and Mujen shochu.

""I was a bit overserved last night,"" he said in the clip. ""I had so much fun though, and I hope you did too!""",None
Rupert Grint Tells Emma Watson 'I Love You' — But Just 'As a Friend',"Laughing through the tears. HBO Max’s Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts special featured some emotional moments between the stars, and Rupert Grint knew exactly how to make Emma Watson smile when they both started crying.

In the reunion, released on Saturday, January 1, the Ron and Hermione actors had a chance to sit down one-on-one to reflect on their time filming the eight movies together. Grint, now 33, and Watson, now 31, started filming the movie in the year 2000.

“The way it feels for me now, like, seeing you here, having had time apart — I’m gonna try not to get emotional,” the Little Women star said as she started to get choked up. “It feels like you’re, like, a pillar of my life.”

Grint said the Brown University alum was just as significant in his own childhood. “That’s a very overwhelming thing because I’ve watched you grow up. We’ve watched each other grow up. We grew up together. We’re family. We don’t need to see each — Oh, my God,” he chuckled as he realized he was getting teary-eyed too.

The Servant actor continued, “Even though we don’t see each other all the time, yeah. It’s a strong bond that we will always have, and we will always be part of each other’s lives.”

The actors held hands and leaned in for a hug. “Oh, it’s so nice to see you,” Watson said.

“It’s so good to see you,” the Sick Note star replied. “I love you.”

The Paris-born thespian nodded as she wiped tears from her eyes, and her former costar decided to lighten the tender moment, adding, “As a friend.”

Watson burst into laughter. “Just to be clear for everyone watching,” she giggled.

“Just to be clear,” he smiled before turning serious again. “But it’s true. There’s so much love.”

The activist was clearly touched by his heartfelt declaration. “Oh, thanks Rupes,” she said.

Of course, the reunion special wasn’t just about Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They were joined by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), who apologized to the two for teasing them so much when their characters finally had to kiss in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. The special also included Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), who Watson explained stole her heart while in the on-set classroom.

HBO Max brought in quite a few familiar Hogwarts alums. Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom), Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley), Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), Oliver Phelps (George Weasley), Alfred Enoch (Dean Thomas). Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange), Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) and more returned to the Hogwarts sets in Watford, England for the New Year’s Day special.

Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts explored the legacy of the fantasy series since the first movie debuted in November 2001. Following Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, J.K. Rowling continued to tell the story of Harry Potter adjusting to life as a wizard at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, all while trying to take down Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) in six more books. Before the reunion special was released on HBO Max, Watson reflected on the memories she made playing Hermione over the years.

“Harry Potter was my home, my family, my world and Hermione (still is) my favorite fictional character of all time. I think a journalist once said it was irritating how many times during an interview I mentioned how lucky I was and started counting… BUT I DAMN WELL KNEW!!! And still know,” she gushed via Instagram in November 2021. “I am proud not just of what we as a group contributed as actors to the franchise but also as the children that became young adults that walked that path.”

At the time, the activist also explained how much work went into creating such a lasting memory with Harry Potter.

“I look at my fellow cast members now and I am just so proud of who everyone has become as people. I am proud we were kind to each other that we supported one another and that we held up something meaningful,” Watson noted. “Thank you to the fans that have continued to show their support well after the last chapter closed. The magic of the world wouldn’t exist without you. Thank you for fighting to make it such an inclusive and loving place. I still miss the crew who made these films all the time. Thank you for all of your hard work too – I know your contributions sometimes get overlooked.”

Lewis, for his part, explained during the reunion special how much playing Neville meant to him during his formative years.

“Not least because I played him, obviously, but just what he stood for, really … the goodness in him. The fact that through all of life’s challenges, whether he was bullied at school or the things that happened in his childhood to his parents, he never veered from the path,” the Terminal star added. “He always stayed true to his ideals, to what he believed in, and what was the right thing to do.”

He continued: “People do get rocked by a lot and Neville got rocked by a lot and he never let it shift his morals, his ethics. I think that’s important. He could’ve been forgiven for holding some bitterness and resentment at life for everything that happened to him. And he never did. And he worked tirelessly to fight the good fight. And that’s the incredible strength of character. He’s a beacon of light in the story, I think, and an inspiration for us all.”

Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts is now streaming on HBO Max. A cable television premiere is expected in spring ahead of the April release of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.",2022-01-01 18:55:49+00:00

Alfred Molina Reveals How Doc Ock Was Different In 'No Way Home' Compared To 'Spider-Man 2,"After a long wait and putting end to several speculations, Spider-Man: No Way Home got released globally last week and has been declared as the world's number one movie currently. The movie brought back some of the fans' favourite characters from the previous Spider-Man outings like Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro and many more. Alfred Molina, who essays the role of Doctor Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, recently opened up his return to the franchise and compared how Doc Ock has changed in No Way Home compared to 2004's Spider-Man 2.

Alfred Molina Compares Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home's Doc Ock

As per ScreenRant, during a behind-the-scenes deep-dive with Sony, Alfred Molina opened up about his return to Spider-Man: No Way Home and shared how his character had changed since the 2004 movie Spider-Man 2002. He said, ""What I thought was so wonderful about [Spider-Man 2], the first time, was they gave Doc Ock this wonderful redemptive moment. And like all great villains, like a lot of villains in the Marvel universe, he’s become a villain kind of reluctantly — or almost by accident.""

He added, ""I knew that when Jon Watts described what’s going to be Doc Ock’s first appearance in this film, he just knows it’s going to be a moment of jaw-dropping awe. I wanted to make sure that I was in the right place in terms of the performance, so it was useful to go back and look at [Spider-Man 2]. But at the same time, it’s a different director, it’s a different movie, there’s a freshness to it, so I didn’t want to just come back and replicate what we’d done before. It was important to me to arrive as if this were the first time.""

No Way Home also saw the return of previous Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as they helped Tom Holland's web-slinger, and for the first time ever all three Spider-Man's were seen on the big screen together. The return of Maguire and Garfield was the subject of speculation, and Sony, Marvel and the cast attempted to conceal their involvement, despite numerous leaks. The film also features Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori and Marisa Tomei.

Stevie Nicks Supported Christine McVie’s Exit From Fleetwood Mac: ‘Pack Your Bags and Go Home’,"After decades of performing with the band, one of Fleetwood Mac’s two female members, Christine McVie, decided to retire. Though she eventually returned after a 16-year hiatus, her exit initially seemed permanent. Her bandmate and close friend Stevie Nicks explained that she was completely supportive of McVie’s decision, even though she was relieved when the lengthy hiatus ended.

Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie became close friends while in Fleetwood Mac

After McVie helped welcome Nicks into Fleetwood Mac, the two became fast friends. They stuck together, particularly when the band dynamic soured after both woman’s breakups. They helped each other navigate the primarily male-dominated world of rock and roll.

https://twitter.com/ThatEricAlper/status/1314543689830629376

“Christine [McVie] and I were a force of nature,” Nicks told NME. “In the first two months I was in the band, Chris and I made a pact that we would never be in a room full of famous English or American guitar players and be treated like second class citizens.”

According to Harper’s Bazaar, Nicks is grateful for McVie, referring to her as a “mentor, sister, and best friend.”

Nicks fully supported McVie’s exit from the band

Given the closeness of their relationship, it was difficult for Nicks when McVie chose to exit the band in 1998. She had been dealing with anxiety related to flying, something that made international tours nearly impossible. Because of this, she chose to retire and move home to England. Nicks was supportive of this decision.

“I understood why,” she told Vulture. “I understood that in her heart of hearts, she could not do it anymore. There were reasons … she was having panic attacks. She was getting to be afraid to fly. There’s nothing worse than being afraid to fly. I understood that she needed to go home.”

Nicks said that she personally gave McVie her blessing to leave the band.

“I love Chris, and she was my best friend for 30 years,” she said. “So when your best friend looks at you, in your eyes, and says, ‘I can’t do this anymore,’ you just have to let her go. And I did. I said, ‘Christine, pack your bags and go home. We’ll be fine. It’s not your responsibility to stay in this band for the rest of your life. It’s your responsibility to be true to yourself. You’ve done a great job. You’ve been in a band with Mick [Fleetwood] and John [McVie] for five years before Lindsey [Buckingham] and I even came along. So you’ve paid your dues. Go home.’”

Stevie Nicks was thrilled when Christine McVie rejoined Fleetwood Mac

Though Nicks gave her wholehearted blessing for McVie to leave, she said she was relieved when McVie returned after 16 years.

“When we went on the road, I realized what an amazing friend she’d been of mine that I had lost and didn’t realize the whole consequences of it till now,” Nicks told the Star Tribune. “She brings the funny back into Fleetwood Mac. Before, it was just a boys’ club. With her back, there’s more of a feminine touch to the whole thing. I never want her to ever go out of my life again, and that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with her and I as friends.”",2022-01-01 19:23:00+00:00
‘Below Deck Med’: Bobby Giancola Recalls ‘the Absolute Worst’ New Year’s Eve Ever (Exclusive),"Many Below Deck yachties typically work over the holidays, which often includes New Year’s Eve. Former Below Deck Mediterranean deckhand Bobby Giancola recalled one season on a boat which became his worst New Year’s Eve memory ever.

He told Showbiz Cheat Sheet that many crews stick with the same captain. So when a new captain takes over a vessel most of the crew will leave – or the captain makes life miserable enough that remaining crew members become “inspired” to leave. Unfortunately for Giancola, he spent New Year’s Eve dealing with a captain who wanted him to quit.

Bobby Giancola’s worst New Year’s Eve memory was on a yacht

Giancola said he’s had some “horrible” New Year’s but the experience on that boat was definitely the very worst. “I mean, probably like the first thing I can think of my worst New Year’s was I was working on a boat,” he recalled.

Captain Sandy Yawn, Hannah Ferrier, Adam Glick, Bugsy Drake, Lauren Cohen, Malia White, Max Hagley, Bobby Giancola, Wes Walton from Below Deck Med speak with a charter guest |Virginia Sherwood/Bravo/ NBCU Photo Bank

“And, long story short, the captain and I did not get along,” Giancola continued. “He was a new captain. My captain had quit to do another program, which eventually I followed him to that boat. But a lot of the time in yachting when a new captain comes on board with all the original crew, he cleans house or makes it to where everybody quits. And then he brings in his people, and that’s kind of what happened.”

“Like he didn’t talk to me,” he added. “When I would try to talk to him. He didn’t talk back. And all he would talk about is how amazing his last first mate was and how he did everything. And so it just made the New Year’s just awful.”

Colin Macy-O’Toole said New Year’s Eve is his least favorite holiday

While Colin Macy-O’Toole from Below Deck Med can’t point to a specific time when New Year’s Eve was a bust, he said he’s just not a big fan of the holiday. “New Year’s is my number one, least favorite holiday of the year,” he told Showbiz Cheat Sheet. “You know, you just feel like there’s so much pressure like making plans. It’s so annoying, like ‘She’s doing this and he’s doing that, like, what am I doing?’ You know?”

He’s also at a different point in his life where most of his friends are married or have kids. “So yeah, now that everyone has kids now, it’s like, I go to my buddy’s house, you know, a couple of blocks over,” he shared. “We’ll have a couple of drinks and then at 12:05 I’m out of there.”

Did Bobby and Colin make New Year’s resolutions?

Macy-O’Toole also isn’t a big fan of making a New Year’s resolution either. “Hopefully 2022 is a good successful year for everybody, and especially with all the s*** that we’re all going through,” he remarked. “And it’s just, you know, it’s just one of those things of wanting normalcy again. I just hope everyone can stay healthy and kind of get back to normal.”

While Giancola agreed with Macy-O’Toole, he also strives for more of a work/life balance in 2022. “I’m going to do my best to get back in the gym, I know that’s such a cliche New Year’s resolution but it’s been years since I’ve been in the gym,” he remarked.

“And now things that have heated up with being a yacht broker,” Giancola added. “And I’m able to breathe a little bit now and kind of pull back the reins a little bit with work.

‘RHOC’: Vicki Gunvalson and Steve Lodge’s Relationship Crumbled During ‘RHUGT’ – and She Hates Dating,"Vicki Gunvalson from The Real Housewives of Orange County faced the dissolution of her relationship with Steve Lodge while she filmed The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip.

Friends Tamra Judge from RHOC and Dorinda Medley from The Real Housewives of New York City recently discussed their experience on RHUGT and shared that Gunvalson had to deal with being filmed while at the same time enduring a breakup. Medley said watching it happen was difficult and Judge said while Gunvalson has started dating, she isn’t loving it.

Did Dorinda Medley have tough love for Vicki Gunvalson during ‘RHUGT’?

Medley’s Blue Stone Manor was the setting for the second season of RHUGT and she said the overall experience was interesting. She then hinted at having a moment with Gunvalson about her breakup with Lodge that may have been a little tough for Gunvalson to hear.

“After all that stuff happened with Vicki and Steve, we kind of saw it happening while we were there,” she said on the Two T’s in a Pod podcast. “That was tough.”

Judge then said that Medley “kind of nailed it,” hinting that Medley said something very direct to Gunvalson.

“Yeah, but that didn’t make me feel good,” Medley replied. “But I was like, you know, you got the old thing. I tell it like it is, but I always make it nice. I told it like it was but didn’t make it nice. But I could see the writing on the wall.”

Vicki Gunvalson wanted to leave Blue Stone Manor during filming?

A source told US Weekly that Gunvalson was distraught during RHUGT Season 2 filming because she and Lodge had broken up. “Steve broke up with Vicki while she was filming the [Real Housewives] spinoff show in the Berkshires,” the source said. “After he told her this, she was traumatized. It ruined her. She didn’t want to be at the [Dorinda Medley’s] house anymore.”

“She’s in terrible shape. She still loves him,” the source added. “They had not been getting along for a long time. He seemed disinterested in her for a very long time.”

Gunvalson recently reflected on how her split from Lodge seemed very similar to Lala Kent from Vanderpump Rules and Randall Emmett’s breakup. Kent recalled how Emmett spoiled her at first and recalled how much she loved him on the Not Skinny but Not Fat podcast. But now Kent can’t remember much of the relationship except for the heartbreak. “Sounds very similar to the man who stole almost 6 years of my life that I will never get back. So hurtful, so wrong,” Gunvalson wrote on the podcast Instagram.

Tamra Judge from ‘RHOC’ says Vicki Gunvalson is dating (but hates it)

Medley asked Judge if Gunvalson was dating. Judge said she was, but it wasn’t going very well. “I think she’s starting to date,” Judge said. “Yeah, she’s trying it.”

https://twitter.com/tamrajudgeOC/status/1461346688266752012

Judge then recounted a recent date Gunvalson went on where she suddenly tried to FaceTime Judge in the middle of it. “She calls me. She hates it,” she said. Judge added, “She texted me the other night or FaceTimed me, I’m sick as a dog. And she’s like, pick up your FaceTime! I said no I’m dying! So I turn all the lights off. Accepted it and it’s some guy she’s with on a date who’s very nice. [But] I told her to screen these guys, you’re dating radar is horrible, horrible!”",2022-01-01 10:14:00+00:00
‘Sister Wives’: Kody Brown Reiterates That He Has No Romantic Relationship With Meri Brown,"Kody Brown really wants Sister Wives fans to understand that he and his first wife, Meri Brown, have absolutely no romantic relationship. On the Dec. 26 episode, Kody reminded fans that his housing rotation, pre-pandemic, did not include time spent at Meri’s home. While he insisted his rotation was fair and equitable, fans who have followed the Brown family for the last decade aren’t buying it.

Kody Brown and Meri Brown admitted to having no romantic relationship last year

The trouble between Kody and Meri Brown is nothing new. When fans first met the couple in 2010, things seemed to be going well. In 2015, the relationship went awry after Kody legally divorced Meri to marry his fourth wife, Robyn Brown. Shortly after the divorce, Meri was caught in a catfishing scandal. The catfishing scandal appeared to be the final blow for the couple’s romantic relationship. Things have been icy between them since.

During season 15 of Sister Wives, Meri and Kody got real about their relationship. In a series of interviews, the couple admitted to being mostly estranged. They both revealed that they have absolutely no romantic relationship, and Kody certainly doesn’t seem keen on changing that. Meri, for some reason, continues to hold out hope that the romance will return.

Kody Brown explained his pre-pandemic housing rotation

On the Dec. 26 episode of Sister Wives, Kody sat down for an interview and discussed how he divided his time before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic set in. Kody explained that he would spend two days with three of his four wives. He said he would spend two days with Janelle Brown, then two days with Robyn Brown, followed by two days with Christine Brown. The schedule would then repeat unless a special event came up.

Kody made it a point to say that Meri was not part of the rotation because he did not spend evenings at her home. He emphasized that he and Meri are strictly friends. While the statement felt like a low blow to Sister Wives fans, it’s not new information. Both Kody and Meri have made it clear that there is no intimacy in their relationship.

Fans think Kody is spending all of his time with his fourth wife

Kody insists that his pre-pandemic schedule was fair and equitable, but fans aren’t exactly buying it. While it’s clear he has spent all of his time with Robyn since the start of the pandemic, fans think he has spent the majority of his time with Robyn before that, too. In fact, it has been rumored that Kody has only been spending time with Robyn since the family’s move to Flagstaff, Arizona, in 2018.

If Kody was telling the truth, things have changed significantly now. Robyn is receiving even more attention now that one of the three wives she was allegedly splitting time with has left the state. In November 2021, Christine announced her separation from Kody. She has since moved to Utah to be closer to her children. While Meri remains in Arizona, technically, Sister Wives fans are certain that she is spending the majority of her time in Utah, too.",2022-01-02 03:07:00+00:00
Hailey Bieber Got a New Tattoo in the 1 Place She Told Justin Bieber Not to Put More Ink,"Hailey Bieber Got a New Tattoo in the 1 Place She Told Justin Bieber Not to Put More Ink

Hailey Bieber has a new tattoo, and fans are wondering what Justin Beiber thinks about it. It’s not the design Hailey Bieber got so much as the placement of her new ink that has fans curious. Here’s a look at Bieber’s tattoo and how it’s connected to her famous husband.

Hailey Bieber recently got a new neck tattoo

Famous tattoo artist Doctor Woo recently showed off some ink he gave Hailey Bieber. Doctor Woo has tattooed celebrities like Drake, Miley Cyrus, and Zoe Kravitz.

On Dec. 19, he shared an Instagram post containing a photo of a tattoo he did on Bieber’s neck. Her hair was pulled back to reveal the fresh ink, and she wore a face mask. Her earring, adorned with a jewel-encrusted letter B, is also visible in the image.

The 25-year-old got the words “new york” in delicate handwriting just behind her right ear and below an old tattoo of a tiny diamond.

Doctor Woo captioned the photo, “Lil NY 🍎 love ✍🏼 on Hailey awhile back #hideawayatsuitex #slimneedle.”

Justin Bieber previously revealed that Hailey Bieber told him not to get any more neck tattoos

The location of Bieber’s new ink is surprising since her husband, Justin Bieber, previously shared that she asked him not to get any more tattoos on his neck.

In his 2020 YouTube documentary series “Justin Bieber: Next Chapter,” the 27-year-old musician showed off some of his ink. He pointed out a large rose tattoo he has on his neck.

“I think I’m done on my neck,” Bieber said (via PopCrush). “That’s a Hailey request.”

The “Sorry” singer also revealed that he is saving space on a certain body part for future tattoos. He plans to have children someday, and he said he might get portraits of them on his back.

Both members of the famous couple are covered in ink

Both of the Biebers already have several tattoos, and Justin, in particular, is practically covered in ink.

Body Art Guru says that the “Stay” singer has at least 60 tattoos on his body. He has a large owl on his left forearm, a tiger on his left bicep, and the words “Better At 70” on his thigh. Bieber has a jester on his right arm, his mother’s eye in the crease of his left elbow, and a treble clef behind his left ear.

He also has what appears to be a portrait of his famous ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez as an angel on his left forearm.

While not as tattooed as her husband, Hailey Bieber also has her fair share of body art. According to Body Art Guru, the model has at least 25 small tattoos.

She has her parents’ wedding date (June 10, 1990) in Roman numerals on her left wrist. She also has a tiny gun inked on the inside of the middle finger of her left hand and a little heart on her left ankle.",2022-01-01 17:45:00+00:00
Rose Bowl returns to Pasadena,"PASADENA, Calif. — The Rose Bowl made a triumphant return to Pasadena on Saturday for an exciting showdown between Ohio State and Utah.

A sea of red swarmed outside the stadium before the game, as fans were fired up.

Former Utah football player Jeff Battcher flew from Macon, Georgia to tailgate.

“It’s the granddaddy of them all,” he said. “There’s no doubt this is the biggest event in any football player’s career to play here. I would have given anything to play here.”

Ohio State supporter Tom Murnane made a quick trip from Agoura Hills to see the sporting spectacle.

“Big Buckeye fan, so we go back to Columbus for all the home games,” he said. “Today all we had to do was drive across town for this one, so it’s great.”

After a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases canceled five other bowl games, some weren’t sure if the Rose Bowl would take place.

“I thought that this game could be canceled,” Battcher said. “But I was coming regardless, to be with my friends.”

“We were very concerned,” Murnane said. “Even two hours before kickoff, we’re still crossing our fingers and hoping to play.”

Utah’s fans filled up the stands, taking up more than three-quarters of the Rose Bowl seats.

“This is like a home game for us, you should see all the fans that are here,” Battcher said. “We’re going to dominate in the stands and on the field today.”

Yet the Buckeye faithful weren’t intimidated, as their squad made its 16th Rose Bowl appearance.

“I’m not nervous at all, we’ve been here a lot,” Ohio State fan Jack Doyle said. “I think it’s going to be an easy win, it won’t be a war but I think it’ll go well.”

No matter what side you were rooting for, it was all about ringing in 2022 with an American tradition.

“You don’t do anything on News Years Day except watch football all day long,” Utah fan Maddie Peters said. “That’s just the way it is and we love it.”

When it was all said and done, Ohio State defeated Utah 48-45 in a high-scoring shootout.",2022-01-02 04:09:29+00:00

General Hospital Spoilers: Lulu Spencer Comes Out of Coma – Tracy’s Shocking News Stirs Granddaughter Awake?,"General Hospital (GH) spoilers tease that Lulu Spencer (Emme Rylan) may come out of her coma if the news of Luke Spencer’s (Anthony Geary) death stirs her awake. Laura Collins or Tracy Quatermaine may have to offer updates to comatose Lulu about her deceased dad, but could that prompt a miracle?

During the week of January 3-7, Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) will return to Port Charles – and she’ll bring word of a terrible tragedy.

Thanks to Tracy hitting PC again, the whole town will face devastation. The show’s playing this up as a huge deal in spoilers, so it certainly looks like Luke was killed offscreen.

Of course, Luke’s death is going to affect so many characters in so many different ways.

Laura will no doubt think back on her history with Luke as Kevin Collins (John Lindstrom) pushes her to open up. Kevin will want to be there for Laura as she processes all this, but her mind should go to Lulu eventually.

Laura and Tracy might feel the need to pay Lulu a visit in her long-term care facility and deliver this tragic news. They may admit Luke died and cry by Lulu’s bedside over all the losses faced over the years.

It’d be a great story if Lulu responded to Laura and Tracy’s updates on Luke and finally opened her eyes.

Perhaps something good could come out of the tragedy if it managed to stir Lulu Spencer awake and helped her rejoin society. Luke’s end could help Lulu get a miraculous new beginning in that case.

It would soften the blow of losing Luke, especially since there’s been more than enough death and destruction on GH lately.

Many fans would like to see some positive developments and returns to go along with the crushing outcomes.

There’s surely a reason why the writers chose to keep Lulu alive rather than killing her off.

By putting Lulu in a coma, they made it inevitable that she would rise from it one day.

Whether that happens with Emme Rylan in the role or a recast takes over, Lulu Spencer’s return would be a welcome one.

General Hospital spoilers say some huge changes are ahead in Port Charles, so stay tuned to see how it all plays out!

The Bold and the Beautiful Spoilers: Deacon Blamed for Switching Brooke’s Champagne – Sheila Lets Former Friend Take Fall?,"The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers tease that Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) could get blamed for switching Brooke Forrester’s (Katherine Kelly Lang) Champagne, so will Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) let her former friend take the fall?

B&B fans know Sheila was furious when Brooke threatened to destroy the progress she’s made with her family.

Brooke intends to do whatever it takes to keep Sheila away – especially from Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), John “Finn” Finnegan (Tanner Novlan) and Hayes Forrester Finnegan (Piper Harriot).

Brooke also shut down Sheila’s friendship with Deacon, who did nothing to stop it.

Deacon is too enamored by Brooke to go against her, so that gives Sheila a motive to turn against him as well.

Sheila carried out a twisted plan, which involved putting a nonalcoholic label on a bottle of real bubbly.

After Brooke’s wild New Year’s Eve with Deacon, she’s going to wake up with a horrible hangover and know something’s seriously wrong.

It won’t take Brooke long to figure out that she somehow wound up drinking actual Champagne.

Of course, Brooke won’t tell Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) the whole Deacon story and may not remember it all anyway!

However, Brooke will at least confess to Ridge that she drank and ruined her sobriety.

At some point, Ridge is probably going to examine the bottle and might discover it’s been tampered with. After mulling it over, Ridge may determine that someone seemingly wanted to trick Brooke.

Since Ridge likes to think the worst of Deacon, he may eventually assume Deacon was behind the switcheroo. Sheila might even find a way to plant some evidence and back up that idea.

Regardless, Sheila may act like she has an alibi since she was busy visiting Taylor Hayes’ (Krista Allen) office.

B&B viewers know Sheila had plenty of time to make the switch, but Sheila may pretend she wasn’t anywhere near Il Giardino – unlike Deacon who was working and made sure the delivery guy had the right bottle.

Bottom line, there’s the potential for the finger to be pointed at innocent Deacon.

Ridge may ultimately accuse Deacon of trying to get Brooke drunk enough to hit the sheets with him!

It’ll look particularly bad for Deacon since he came back for his forgotten phone.

It might seem like he planned this whole disastrous night, so we’ll see if Deacon ends up in hot water sooner or later.

The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say Sheila has made a mess that’s only going to get worse, so stay tuned.

General Hospital Spoilers: Sasha & Michael Reconnect – Angry Heartache Pushes Exes Back Together?,"General Hospital (GH) spoilers tease that Sasha Gilmore (Sofia Mattsson) and Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) may reconnect over some angry heartache. Will similar struggles push these exes back together?

Michael and Sasha were in love once upon a time, but Sasha and Harrison Chase’s (Josh Swickard) fake affair tore them apart.

It devastated Sasha to lose Michael, but she felt she had to make that sacrifice and give him a nudge toward a marriage with Willow Tait (Katelyn MacMullen).

Chase and Sasha knew that marriage would boost Michael’s chances against Nelle Benson (Chloe Lanier) in the custody battle over Wiley Quartermaine-Corinthos (Viron Weaver), so they did what they had to do.

Unfortunately, Sasha was never able to recapture what she lost with Michael once the truth came out.

Michael legitimately fell for Willow, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten what he once felt for Sasha.

There’s the potential for Sasha and Michael’s romance to come back around now that they’re facing new challenges in their current relationships.

Michael has turned into a raging, bitter version of himself that’s hard to even recognize. However, there’s pain underneath that anger.

Michael lost so much time with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and felt the devastating blow of losing his dad. can’t forgive Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) for that and doesn’t like the fact that Sonny’s being so protective of her.

Although Michael didn’t really blame Willow for keeping Nina’s secret, there’s no denying that she did keep it under wraps – and that matters.

Willow chose to listen to Nina instead of coming clean with Michael, so GH writers are going to worsen the trust issues between them.

This will build on the conflict that was already there since Willow doesn’t like this vengeful side of Michael.

Although Willow understands Michael’s frustration, she doesn’t want him going too far in his quest for revenge.

Willow is never going to be in Michael’s shoes and won’t understand the depth of what he’s feeling.

Sasha will be in a similar boat since she won’t think Brando Corbin (Johnny Wactor) understands her either.

Sasha’s dealing with the loss of Liam Corbin and no doubt wondering why he was taken from her so soon.

The details of Sasha’s situation may be different, but the gist is the same – a tough mix of emotions including pain and anger plus a partner who just doesn’t quite get it.

It’s easy to see how Michael and Sasha could reunite over all that sooner or later.

That’s especially true since we know Michael’s relationship is about to head downhill fast – and Sasha seems poised to push Brando away eventually, too.

There’ll be a disconnect for both couples, so that could bring a Michael and Sasha reunion down the road.

General Hospital spoilers say Sasha and Michael have some tough times ahead of them, so stay tuned to see if they’ll lean on each other again.

Changing “Sponginess” of Cell Nuclei Help Them Decide Their Future,"Shifting transmission of physical stimuli plays key role in cell differentiation.

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have discovered how the sponginess and stickiness of stem cell nuclei controls how they “differentiate” into specialized cells. They found that the nucleus starts solid-like but becomes more fluid-like over time. Less force is transmitted to its inner parts, leaving cells to commit to a certain differentiation pathway. How stem cells choose and keep to differentiation paths continues to be a crucial question for medical science.

Much of our understanding of biological materials and living systems is a biochemical one, an intricate patchwork of pathways connecting a vast array of complex chemicals. However, the rapidly emerging field of mechanobiology takes a different approach, looking at how living materials respond to physical stimuli, like the softness of the inside and outside of a cell. Complex mixtures such as the interior of a cell have both a spongy, solid-like character (elasticity) and a sticky, liquid-like character (viscosity), summing to a more complete description of how materials respond to forces. This is known as viscoelasticity.

The same applies not only to cells but the things they are made of. A team led by Associate Professor Hiromi Miyoshi of Tokyo Metropolitan University have been looking at the nuclei of human mesenchymal stem cells, a type of cell that can mature (or “differentiate”) into a wide range of cell types, including muscle, fat, bone, and cartilage. They introduced tiny, inert beads into nuclei where they were seen to wiggle under the action of thermal energy in the surroundings. The team studied this motion and measured the viscoelasticity of nucleus interiors, a method known as micro-rheology. The technique gives two quantities, the storage and loss moduli, which correspond to the elasticity and viscosity of materials. They focused their attention on nuclei as they differentiated into osteoblasts (bone cells). This was the first time that the viscoelasticity of nuclei was tracked through the whole differentiation process in human stem cells.

As the cells became more differentiated and specialized, the team found that the nuclei became less solid, and more liquid-like. When a solid ball of matter is poked, the force is transmitted directly to its core. This is not the case when it is more viscous than elastic. As it becomes more fluid-like, the nucleus becomes less susceptible to external forces as it differentiates, committing more and more to the differentiation path it has chosen, a balance between what is known as plasticity (responsiveness to change) and homeostasis (resistance to change). Looking at the distribution of DNA in the nucleus, they discovered that much of the change in the viscoelastic nature of the nuclei is to do with the aggregation of chromatin, multi-component structures made of DNA and proteins.

For a long time, it was believed that the aggregation of chromatin had everything to do with the suppression of certain genes. The DNA in chromatin is the instruction booklet for the synthesis of proteins; condensation of chromatin is like sticking pages together to make them unreadable. Now, the team’s findings show that it also serves a completely different purpose, careful tuning how responsive the nucleus is to external forces, particularly in ensuring that it can commit to a certain differentiation path. Their findings are a milestone in understanding the intricate workings of a fascinating system which underpins the development of much of the human body.

Scientists Uncover the Evolutionary Genetic Pathway That Colors Bumble Bee Stripes,"Roar supercomputer provides computational power for data-intense gene expression studies.

While most people in the U.S. may think of bumble bees as the standard yellow and black variety, there are an estimated 260 bee species that sport about 400 different color patterns. One reason many people associate bumble bees with distinct colors is because evolution can influence multiple bee species to share similar color patterns in specific geographic regions, which scientists call mimicry.

When multiple species mimic each other’s patterns they alert would-be predators in a certain area that when they see these colors, a painful sting may follow. In other places of the world, bees use a palette of blacks, oranges, reds, yellows, and whites to create that shared warning signal.

Now, researchers are finding out more about the role that evolutionary genetics plays in shaping the distinctive color patterns that give different bee species their regional flare.

In a study, the researchers report how a Hox gene, a major developmental gene that regulates the identity of structures on the segments of the bee, turns on a complex set of downstream genes that ultimately drive segmental changes in the bee’s pigmentation.

“In a previous paper, what we couldn’t explain is how a change in the Hox gene called Abdominal-B leads to a change in the pigments that color these bees,” said Heather Hines, associate professor of biology and entomology. “In this particular paper, we were trying to fill in that gap and understand what genes are being targeted by this first gene, and what is the cascade of events that ultimately leads to these mimetic color differences.”

The researchers, who report their findings in a recent issue of Genome Biology and Evolution, found that genomic targeting of a major developmental gene allows several melanin genes, rather than just one specific enzyme, to be altered to reinforce these color traits. They also said that the study adds to the knowledge about the genes involved in the production of a pigment called pheomelanin. The pigment was known to be involved in red coloration in vertebrates, but only recently was found to occur in insects.

According to Hines, a lot of work remains on understanding the evolutionary genetics of these bees. “Understanding these genes, we now have the potential to look at so many different bee species and how they’ve diversified,” said Hines. “So, it’s not a case that once we are finished here that we’re done. Given the diversity in these bees, there’s just so much more that can be done with the discovery. This is just really the first step.”

Researchers tend to use certain organisms — or model organisms — when they investigate evolutionary genetics because they are convenient and easy to study. This is one of the few studies that looked at coloration genes outside of these well-studied organisms, or non-models. Studying non-model systems allows researchers to understand the evolution of some of nature’s most exceptional diversifications of form, such as this color radiation.

“This really adds to non-model, evolutionary genetic research, which is a growing field and the field is also expanding to be more comparative,” Hines said. “As we move forward, researchers will be looking at how genes and gene pathways have evolved across a broader diversity of species.”

Computationally expensive research: ROAR to the rescue

“The use of high-performance computation power has made this type of research more manageable and reproducible,” said Sarthok Rahman, former doctoral student and ICDS student affiliate, Penn State and postdoctoral researcher in biological sciences, University of Alabama, and first author of the study.

The researchers relied on the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences’ Roar supercomputer to provide that computational power for the gene expression studies on the bees.

“We did the sequencing in the Genomics Core Facility, and then we mostly used the operational server for the differential gene expression analysis. Because it’s a non-model organism, we also have to use other genomic sources from Drosophila and mice, for example, to search the genes and assign the identity,” said Rahman. “These analyses can be pretty computationally expensive and would take a lot of time if it were done on an everyday laptop or desktop, which is why we used the ICDS supercomputing facility for this paper and the paper before it.”

Antarctica’s “Doomsday” Glacier: Its Collapse Could Trigger Global Floods and Swallow Islands,"The massive Thwaites glacier in West Antarctica contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by 65cm if it were to completely collapse. And, worryingly, recent research suggests that its long-term stability is doubtful as the glacier hemorrhages more and more ice.

Adding 65cm to global sea levels would be coastline-changing amounts. For context, there’s been around 20cm of sea-level rise since 1900, an amount that is already forcing coastal communities out of their homes and exacerbating environmental problems such as flooding, saltwater contamination and habitat loss.

But the worry is that Thwaites, sometimes called the “doomsday glacier” because of its keystone role in the region, might not be the only glacier to go. Were it to empty into the ocean, it could trigger a regional chain reaction and drag other nearby glaciers in with it, which would mean several meters of sea-level rise. That’s because the glaciers in West Antarctica are thought to be vulnerable to a mechanism called Marine Ice Cliff Instability or MICI, where retreating ice exposes increasingly tall, unstable ice cliffs that collapse into the ocean.

A sea level rise of several meters would inundate many of the world’s major cities – including Shanghai, New York, Miami, Tokyo, and Mumbai. It would also cover huge swathes of land in coastal regions and largely swallow up low-lying island nations like Kiribati, Tuvalu, and the Maldives.

As big as Britain

Thwaites is a frozen river of ice approximately the size of Great Britain. It already contributes around 4% of the global sea-level rise. Since 2000, the glacier has had a net loss of more than 1000 billion tons of ice and this has increased steadily over the last three decades. The speed of its flow has doubled in 30 years, meaning twice as much ice is being spewed into the ocean as in the 1990s.

Thwaites glacier, the widest in the world at 80 miles wide, is held back by a floating platform of ice called an ice shelf, which restrains the glacier and makes it flow less quickly. But scientists have just confirmed that this ice shelf is becoming rapidly destabilized. The eastern ice shelf now has cracks criss-crossing its surface, and could collapse within ten years, according to Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University.

This work supports research published in 2020 which also noted the development of cracks and crevasses on the Thwaites ice shelf. These indicate that it is being structurally weakened. This damage can have a reinforcing feedback effect because cracking and fracturing can promote further weakening, priming the ice shelf for disintegration.

If Thwaites’ ice shelf did collapse, it would spell the beginning of the end for the glacier. Without its ice shelf, Thwaites glacier would discharge all its ice into the ocean over the following decades to centuries.



New research on Thwaites glacier and its future.

Other unstable glaciers

The ice shelf – which can be thought of as the floating extension of Thwaites glacier – is one of several that scientists are watching closely in the Amundsen Sea Basin, West Antarctica. Several ice shelves that hold back glaciers there, including Thwaites and its next-door neighbour, the Pine Island glacier, are being eroded by rising ocean temperatures.

Warmer ocean water is able to undercut these floating ice shelves, driving melting from below that can thin the ice and weaken it, allowing the cracks and fractures that have been observed at the surface to develop. This ocean-driven melting at the bottom of the ice shelf also pushes the anchoring point where the ice meets the seabed backwards. Because the seabed slopes downwards in the Amundsen Sea, that could eventually trigger a shift as the glaciers lose their footing and retreat rapidly.

Ultimately, if the ice shelves retreat, it means there is less holding the West Antarctic glaciers back – allowing them to accelerate and add more to global sea levels.

However, scientists are still getting to grips with MICI and questions remain about the future of West Antarctic glaciers. While the collapse of Thwaites certainly could trigger a wholesale collapse event, not everyone believes this will happen.

Other work suggests that the destabilization of the Thwaites ice shelf and glacier may not lead to the kind of catastrophic outcomes that some fear. Sea ice and chunks of ice that break away from the collapsing ice shelf and glacier might have a similar restraining effect to the intact ice shelf, nipping the chain reaction in the bud and preventing the sustained collapse of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet.

But while uncertainty remains about exactly what will happen in West Antarctica, one thing is for sure – the retreating Thwaites glacier will continue to add to global sea levels for many years to come.

Study Confirms Southern Ocean is Absorbing Carbon,"Your browser does not support the video tag.

New observations from research aircraft indicate that the Southern Ocean absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases, confirming that it is a strong carbon sink and an important buffer for the effects of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Previous research and modeling had left researchers uncertain about how much atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gets absorbed by the chilly waters circling the Antarctic continent.

In a NASA-supported study published in Science in December 2021, scientists used aircraft observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide to “show that the annual net flux of carbon into the ocean south of 45°S is large, with stronger summertime uptake and less wintertime outgassing than other recent observations have indicated.” They found that the waters in the region absorbed roughly 0.53 more petagrams (530 million metric tons) of carbon than they released each year.

“Airborne measurements show a drawdown of carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere over the Southern Ocean surface in summer, indicating carbon uptake by the ocean,” explained Matthew Long, lead author of the study and a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Aircraft observations were collected from 2009 to 2018 during three field experiments, including NASA’s Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) in 2016.

The animation and still image on this page show areas where carbon dioxide was absorbed (blue) and emitted (red) by the global ocean in 2012. (Jump to 1:00 to focus on the Southern Hemisphere.) The data come from the ECCO-Darwin Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Model. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

When human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide enter the atmosphere, some of the gas is absorbed by the ocean, a process that can slightly slow carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and the global temperature increases that go with it. Part of this is due to upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean. Once at the surface, colder, nutrient-rich water absorbs CO 2 from the atmosphere—usually with the help of photosynthesizing organisms called phytoplankton—before sinking again.

Computer models suggest that 40 percent of the human-produced CO 2 in the ocean worldwide was originally absorbed from the atmosphere into the Southern Ocean, making it one of the most important carbon sinks on our planet. But measuring the flux, or exchange, of CO 2 from the air to the sea has been challenging.

Many previous studies of Southern Ocean carbon flux relied heavily on measurements of ocean acidity—which increases when seawater absorbs CO 2 —taken by floating, drifting instruments. The new research used aircraft to measure changes in the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere over the ocean.

“You can’t fool the atmosphere,” Long said. “While measurements taken from the ocean surface and from land are important, they are too sparse to provide a reliable picture of air-sea carbon flux. The atmosphere, however, can integrate fluxes over large expanses.”

For the new study, researchers used airborne measurements from three field experiments: ATom, HIPPO, and ORCAS. Collectively, the field experiments captured a series of snapshots (or profiles) of the vertical change in carbon dioxide across various altitudes of the atmosphere and various seasons. For example, during the ORCAS campaign in early 2016, scientists saw a drop in CO 2 concentrations as the plane descended and also detected high turbulence near the ocean surface, suggesting an exchange of gases. Such profiles, along with several atmospheric models, helped the team better estimate the flux of carbon.

James Webb Space Telescope successfully unfurls crucial sunshield,"1/5

Jan. 1 (UPI) -- A massive sunshield aboard the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope has been successfully unfurled in a crucial step for its operations, NASA says. The telescope's second, or starboard, sunshield mid-boom was extended late Friday as the observatory ""passed another critical deployment milestone,"" the space agency announced. Advertisement

The deployment capped a two-day operation in which all 107 the telescope's crucial membrane release devices were successfully released, thus allowing the sunshield to fully unfurl into its kite-shaped form in space.

Shine bright like a diamond With the successful deployment of our right sunshield mid-boom, or ""arm,"" Webb's sunshield has now taken on its diamond shape in space.

Driven by their motors, the mid-booms slowly extended horizontally from the spacecraft, pulling the folded membranes of the sunshield along to their full 47-foot width. The mid-boom arms are now locked in their final position.

""The mid-booms are the sunshield's workhorse and do the heavy lifting to unfold and pull the membranes into that now-iconic shape,"" Webb observatory manager Keith Parrish said in a statement.

But, he cautioned, ""we still have a long way to go with this whole deployment process,"" as engineers in the coming days will separate and then individually tighten each of the five sunshield layers to reach their final, taut shape.

Webb is just nine days into a 29-day deployment process in which the telescope will unfold and unfurl at a glacial pace to ensure success.

It's all part of the sophisticated technology that will make Webb the largest and most powerful telescope in history. It will use super-cooled infrared instruments to observe exoplanets, black holes, and galaxies that formed 13.5 billion years ago, the earliest ever seen.

RELATED James Webb telescope to begin sun shield deployment

But those instruments must be so cold -- minus-370 degrees F -- that sunlight or even Webb's own thrusters could cause interference. So the sun shield will wall off the instruments from those heat sources.

The membrane layers are designed with space in between them to allow heat to radiate out, with the largest and flattest layer being closest to the sun.

"Stopping Dementia at the Nose – Nasal Spray To Treat, Prevent Alzheimer’s Disease","Via drug repositioning, Osaka City University creates combination of rifampicin and resveratrol and have shown in mouse models that the nasal administration improves cognitive function without the negative liver side effects of rifampicin alone.

Via drug repositioning, Osaka City University creates combination of rifampicin and resveratrol and have shown in mouse models that the nasal administration improves cognitive function without the negative liver side effects of rifampicin alone.

Dementia is thought to occur when proteins called amyloid-β, tau, and α-synuclein accumulate in the brain and form oligomers. A research group from the Department of Translational Neuroscience, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, had previously shown in a study using mice that the antibiotic rifampicin removes oligomers from the brain and improves cognitive function. However, the drug has been associated with side effects such as liver damage. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring antioxidant in plants, is used as a supplement in Europe and the United States. “To combat the negative side effects of the existing drug rifampicin, we thought of combining it with the hepatoprotective effects of resveratrol,” illustrates Professor Takami Tomiyama, who acted as lead investigator for the current study.

This time, the research group administered a fixed dose combination of rifampicin and resveratrol intranasally five days a week for a total of four weeks to mice models of Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and observed their cognitive functions and brain pathology. The results showed that the combination significantly improved the cognitive function of the mice, inhibited the accumulation of oligomers, and restored synaptophysin levels – presynaptic proteins that facilitate synapses. Additionally, blood levels of liver enzymes, a marker of hepatic damage that normally increases with rifampicin, remained normal in the fixed-dose combination. Furthermore, increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression were observed in the hippocampus, which was not seen with rifampicin alone. These results indicate that this fixed-dose combination is superior to rifampicin alone in terms of both safety and efficacy.

The results of this study were published online in the Swiss scientific journal Frontiers in Neuroscience on December 13, 2021.

“The number of patients with dementia has been increasing all over the world, with some sources predicting a doubling of patients every 20 years. However, there is still no effective treatment for the disease,” states Specially Appointed Lecturer Tomohiro Umeda, first author of the study. “Recent studies have shown that abnormalities begin to appear in the brains of dementia patients more than 20 years before the onset of the disease.” By investigating new therapeutic purposes with existing drugs in a process called drug repositioning, the research team hopes to diagnose and prevent dementia before the neurons start dying.

Furthermore, based on the team’s previous research experience, nasal administration of a fixed dose combination of rifampicin and resveratrol would increase drug transferability to the brain and further enhance both safety and medicinal effects. The dosage used in this study was 0.02 mg of rifampicin per mouse per day, or 1 mg/kg/day assuming a mouse weight of 20g. “Converted to a human dosage based on body surface area, it becomes 0.081 mg/kg/day,” states Prof. Tomiyama, “currently, rifampicin is prescribed at 10 mg/kg/day as an antibiotic, and compared to this, we confirmed an effect at a much lower dosage.”

The development of a fixed-dose combination of rifampicin and resveratrol nasal spray is currently being carried out by Medilabo RFP, a venture company originating from the research team’s laboratory. Following the publication of this paper, Medilabo RFP has begun preparations for global clinical trials. In November 2021, with the support of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), Medilabo RFP has established a subsidiary in Massachusetts, USA.

"Broward Health: Hacker accessed employee, patient data, but no evidence of misuse","FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - An investigation is underway after someone hacked into Broward Health’s network and accessed employee and patient data, officials with the healthcare system said.

In a statement issued Saturday, a spokesperson said the hacker “gained entry gained entry to the Broward Health network through the office of a third-party medical provider, who is permitted access to the system to provide healthcare services.”

Officials said the security breach took place Oct. 19.

The spokesperson wrote, “Broward Health discovered the intrusion … and promptly contained the incident, notified the FBI and the Department of Justice, and engaged an independent cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation.”

Officials said there is no evidence indicating any of the information accessed by the hacker has been misused.

The data includes “name, date of birth, address, phone number, financial or bank account information, Social Security number, insurance information and account number, medical information including history, condition, treatment and diagnosis, medical record number, driver’s license number and email address.”

The spokesperson wrote, “Broward Health has implemented enhanced security protocols to prevent future threats, including a required password reset for all employees [and] multi-factor authentication for all users of its systems.”

Much has changed since the start of the pandemic. But the nation’s public health system remains fractured.,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Mask mandates. Remote classes. Outdoor dining. As 2022 dawns, it’s beginning to look a lot like March 2020 — so much so that President Biden sought to reassure Americans they would not return to those dark days, instead promising a future made safer by vaccines and tests. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Those breakthroughs, along with genomic sequencing that can identify new variants and the promise of powerful antiviral pills, represent a revolutionary assault on the coronavirus. But biomedical advances are only half the battle, experts say.

“We have seen it isn’t enough to have testing and vaccines; you have to have a public health system that can deliver testing and vaccines,” said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The country is at a pivotal moment, Sharfstein said, full of opportunity if the lessons of the past two years lead to a new focus on getting shots in arms, swabs up noses and pills into mouths.

But some experts contend that the imbalance between the country’s scientific advances and its public health response is starker than ever, looking back in wonder on spring 2020 when a largely compliant population submitted to wide-ranging restrictions.

“We are going backward,” said Alfred Sommer, an epidemiologist and former dean at Hopkins.

“People are infinitely less responsive now,” said Sommer, who has tackled outbreaks of cholera and smallpox around the world. “This is different from anything that any public health person I know would have predicted in March 2020.”

When the most striking technological achievement of the pandemic — the mRNA vaccines — became available last winter, Sommer and others predicted the pandemic would be brought under control within months.

Instead, a year later, with little more than 60 percent of the U.S. population fully immunized with two mRNA shots or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson product, the vaccines are providing huge benefits to individuals while failing to fulfill their public health potential of protecting the entire population.

For anybody who trusts science, this is “vastly different than March 2020,” said Francis S. Collins, who in December stepped down as director of the National Institutes of Health, the nation’s medical research agency. But those who don’t trust science and haven’t been vaccinated are in a vulnerable place, he said, endangering everyone around them.

“People should ask themselves which group they want to be in,” Collins said.

In a recent Washington Post Live interview, Collins warned about the dangers of overlooking the lessons of this pandemic. On the research side, he said, scientists are working toward new vaccines and antivirals that will leave Americans less vulnerable to another pathogen that may come our way.

But that half of the equation needs to be matched by improvements on the delivery side, Collins said, by increasing staffing and funding for local health departments, many of which have been running on a shoestring. Officials in some local health departments still transfer data by fax.

There “needs to be a real reset button for the whole system to try to figure out how to be better prepared,” Collins said.

During the past two years, there has been little appetite for organizational overhauls to keep up with the evolving enemy — or prepare for future pandemics — according to Jay A. Winsten, director of strategic media initiatives at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The United States has largely relied on legacy public health systems. One example: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s external advisory board, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, typically makes recommendations for routine vaccines that affect small portions of the population — often children — rather than responding to the minute-by-minute shifts of a worldwide outbreak.

The “processes are designed for a very different moment,” said Ashish K. Jha, a health policy researcher and dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “They are not functioning well in a pandemic.”

The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.

Those organizational shortcomings are coupled with incomplete and sometimes contradictory messages. There was, for example, the early assertion that the general population would not need to wear masks and, later, a months-long disagreement among federal officials about the importance of booster shots, Winsten recalled.

Officials should speak with greater transparency about what they do and do not know, Winsten said, especially in the face of developments such as omicron, even as scientists scramble to learn more about that variant.

“What’s been missing all along, I think, is a publicly visible contingency-planning process that provides a window into the government thinking and advance planning for a range of possible future scenarios,” Winsten said.

Advertisement

The issue, Winsten said, is that misinformation fills the void, leaving local public health officials reacting on the fly instead of focusing on implementing the innovations that science makes available.

“What we have learned is that science isn’t enough; data isn’t enough; research isn’t enough,” said Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a health official from rural Wilson County, Kan., who has faced growing resistance. “We have learned all the science. How do we reach people is the big part.”

Funding from the Cares Act, the economic stimulus legislation passed in 2020, and other sources of pandemic-related federal support have helped with outreach, but the future of those funds is uncertain.

Nilesh Kalyanaraman, who became health officer in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County a couple of months before the pandemic hit, has seen the benefits of investing in delivery systems. The county has partnered with community organizations to provide health ambassadors who knock on doors in census tracts with the highest rates of infection to educate residents about vaccines and other public health measures.

A successful pilot program that was launched in May allowed the initiative to continue through next July. Kalyanaraman would like to make it permanent, bolstering public health measures for chronic conditions and positioning the county to respond more effectively to omicron or any other variant, by reducing the inequities that have characterized the pandemic.

“The question is funding,” Kalyanaraman said. Public health departments still haven’t fully recovered from the financial collapse of 2008, leaving them in a precarious financial position when the pandemic hit, he said.

“That’s what we are looking at — how to invest in the long term. I don’t have the answer for that,” Kalyanaraman said.

While the pandemic’s first two years raised awareness of public health’s antiquated infrastructure, those systems still had not been adequately revamped in time for omicron, according to Sara Cody, the Santa Clara County, Calif., health officer, who described developing homegrown databases to track cases.

“We are the health department in Silicon Valley, and we still get information about hospitalized cases faxed to us,” she said.

The biggest — and fastest-growing — impediment involves staffing. The politicization of the pandemic has exacted personal and professional tolls, even in Maryland, where elected officials have largely supported public health measures. Kalyanaraman said county health officers have been worn down by threats — and that he has endured verbal attacks in public.

Cody received police protection after a man was charged with stalking and threatening her.

After a particularly contentious meeting on masks in a school gym, McKenney, the Kansas health officer, was surprised when the sheriff’s department offered to escort her, concerned for her safety.

“This is my hometown, wow,” McKenney recalled thinking. “I kind of thought I might be shielded from that in my hometown.”

Beth A. Resnick, assistant dean for public health practice at the Hopkins School of Public Health, who testified before Congress in September, said her team of researchers identified at least 1,500 incidents of harassment and violence against public health workers nationally between March 2020 and January 2021. That included sharing private information on the Internet, death threats, protests, intimidation, even shots fired at employees’ homes.

By September 2021, Resnick said, more than 300 state and local public health leaders nationally had retired, resigned or been fired.

Complaints include fatigue and frustration with the hobbled infrastructure and the political attacks on public health, which limited emergency powers in some parts of the country, or shifted authority from health departments to elected officials or other entities, such as school boards.

“They have their hands tied,” Resnick said of public health officials.

McKenney said she sees reason for hope — though not in time to respond to the threats a new variant may bring.

She spoke recently at a conference of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health, where she was struck by the number of students who came up to ask about her work in public health. Their enthusiasm is reflected by a 40 percent increase in applicants to 2021 graduate-level degree programs compared with March 2020, according to the association.

But turning students’ academic aspirations into jobs in local public health departments will depend on sustained funding.

“Everybody gets it. They know that’s where the work needs to be done,” McKenney said. “The upcoming generation is willing to take on that challenge.”

For now, the short-term challenges keep mounting as fresh gaps emerge between biomedical innovations and delivering them to where they are needed.

Shantanu Nundy, a primary care physician who works with low-income populations, has been listening with concern to praise being heaped on the potential benefits of antiviral pills. He anticipates the next problem will be getting pills into mouths. Nundy saw something similar play out with self-administered tests, which he began advocating in March 2020 only to see tests remain difficult to access and often expensive.

The new antiviral medication should be taken within three to five days of onset of symptoms. And it requires a prescription — an almost insurmountable barrier for the 25 percent of the U.S. population who don’t have a primary care physician and others who would have trouble making a prompt appointment, particularly given the wait time for many test results.

“There is an implicit assumption that biomedical innovation will infuse its way into where it’s needed. And we absolutely know that’s not true,” Nundy said.

“Have we not learned anything in the past two years?”

New Year's Resolution? Here's How to Make it Stick,"SATURDAY, Jan. 1, 2022 (HealthDay News) -- It’s clear that these last couple of years have been tough for a lot of people.

So now that it’s the week when people make New Year’s resolutions, go easy on yourself.

If you’d like to make a resolution, start small, the American Psychological Association (APA) suggests. By small, the goal should be one you think you can keep.

For example, if you want to eat healthier, don’t make your diet a form of punishment -- try replacing dessert with something else you enjoy. If your goal is to exercise more, schedule three or four days a week at the gym, not all seven.

""In the past, I’ve spoken to people about setting realistic and practical New Year's resolutions,"" said Jessy Levin, a senior psychologist at Northwell Health in Lake Success, N.Y. ""I've discussed SMART goals and how creating goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-Bound will have the greatest likelihood of success.""

That was prior to the pandemic and more recently Levin said she is encouraging people to set resolutions that ""offer themselves grace and self-forgiveness.""

""We have all been through a tremendously stressful past couple of years. We have watched waves and variants. We have changed how we live our day-to-day,"" Levin said. ""This is not to say that setting goals, especially pro-health goals, are not important. With our lifestyles shifted, improving our diets and activity are important. But so are our mental health goals.""

For those who are setting more standard resolutions, change one behavior at a time, the APA recommends. Replacing unhealthy behaviors with healthy ones can be done over time -- and one at a time -- similar to how unhealthy behaviors develop over time.

Share experiences with family, friends or possibly even a support group to help reach goals such as quitting smoking. This makes the journey to a healthier lifestyle easier and less intimidating, according to the APA.

Know that perfection isn’t attainable and minor missteps are normal, the APA said. Ask for support from those who care about you to help strengthen your resilience, or consider seeking professional help if you feel overwhelmed and unable to reach your goals on your own.

Levin suggests a goal that's more specific to these challenging years, such as a self-forgiveness goal where you allow yourself to be a little late to a meeting so you can finish your coffee before starting work, or pause when you think a family dinner needs to be ""just right.""

Another goal could be gratitude-focused, such as writing down three things you are grateful for each week, Levin recommended. It could be calling or texting someone you haven’t talked with lately.

Levin noted there are increased rates of depression, anxiety and substance abuse as the pandemic continues.

""People are searching to find mental stability amid a changing environment. So this year, let us not be our harshest critics,"" she said. ""Let us offer ourselves kindness, grace and forgiveness. Let us set those as our resolutions.""

Rose Bowl returns to Pasadena,"PASADENA, Calif. — The Rose Bowl made a triumphant return to Pasadena on Saturday for an exciting showdown between Ohio State and Utah.

A sea of red swarmed outside the stadium before the game, as fans were fired up.

Former Utah football player Jeff Battcher flew from Macon, Georgia to tailgate.

“It’s the granddaddy of them all,” he said. “There’s no doubt this is the biggest event in any football player’s career to play here. I would have given anything to play here.”

Ohio State supporter Tom Murnane made a quick trip from Agoura Hills to see the sporting spectacle.

“Big Buckeye fan, so we go back to Columbus for all the home games,” he said. “Today all we had to do was drive across town for this one, so it’s great.”

After a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases canceled five other bowl games, some weren’t sure if the Rose Bowl would take place.

“I thought that this game could be canceled,” Battcher said. “But I was coming regardless, to be with my friends.”

“We were very concerned,” Murnane said. “Even two hours before kickoff, we’re still crossing our fingers and hoping to play.”

Utah’s fans filled up the stands, taking up more than three-quarters of the Rose Bowl seats.

“This is like a home game for us, you should see all the fans that are here,” Battcher said. “We’re going to dominate in the stands and on the field today.”

Yet the Buckeye faithful weren’t intimidated, as their squad made its 16th Rose Bowl appearance.

“I’m not nervous at all, we’ve been here a lot,” Ohio State fan Jack Doyle said. “I think it’s going to be an easy win, it won’t be a war but I think it’ll go well.”

No matter what side you were rooting for, it was all about ringing in 2022 with an American tradition.

“You don’t do anything on News Years Day except watch football all day long,” Utah fan Maddie Peters said. “That’s just the way it is and we love it.”

When it was all said and done, Ohio State defeated Utah 48-45 in a high-scoring shootout.",2022-01-02 04:09:29+00:00
